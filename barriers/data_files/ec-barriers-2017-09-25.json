However, internet piracy (including but not limited to social networks) remains a great concern, and there is only piecemeal progress at best with regard to the goal of approximating Russian copyright legislation in this area to EU and US models.</p>\n<p>Sale and use of counterfeit goods using trademarks for clothes, luxury products, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals products are also widespread and take place both in street markets and in mainstream retail. Furthermore, systematic infringements of patents, commercial secrets and know-how in innovative sectors such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, mechanical engineering and the IT industry continue to injure EU businesses.</p>\n<p>There is also misappropriation of intellectual property rights through obtaining patents for alleged inventions or through registering trademarks that are identical or strikingly similar to the trademarks of foreign companies.</p>\n<p>The establishment of the Customs Union between Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus on 1 January 2010 (the Eurasian Economic Union since 2015) has on balance created additional risks for IPR protection. The borders of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan continue to be under-patrolled, allowing for entry of counterfeit goods and for illegitimate parallel imports from Asian countries, notably China.</p>\n<p>Russia's accession to the WTO and the creation of the new Russian IPR Court in early 2013 could over time prove positive developments.</p>",

However, internet piracy (including but not limited to social networks) remains a great concern, and there is only piecemeal progress at best with regard to the goal of approximating Russian copyright legislation in this area to EU and US models.</p>\n<p>Sale and use of counterfeit goods using trademarks for clothes, luxury products, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals products are also widespread and take place both in street markets and in mainstream retail. Furthermore, systematic infringements of patents, commercial secrets and know-how in innovative sectors such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, mechanical engineering and the IT industry continue to injure EU businesses.</p>\n<p>There is also misappropriation of intellectual property rights through obtaining patents for alleged inventions or through registering trademarks that are identical or strikingly similar to the trademarks of foreign companies.</p>\n<p>The establishment of the Customs Union between Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus on 1 January 2010 (the Eurasian Economic Union since 2015) has on balance created additional risks for IPR protection. The borders of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan continue to be under-patrolled, allowing for entry of counterfeit goods and for illegitimate parallel imports from Asian countries, notably China.</p>\n<p>Russia's accession to the WTO and the creation of the new Russian IPR Court in early 2013 could over time prove positive developments.</p>",

        "description": "<p>SA authorities take several years to evaluate questionnaires used in the negotiations of import permits and health certificates by new applicants (such as in the case of a number of EU MS). For pork and other meats, SA operates a queue system with no indication of duration for the handling of the application. SA authorities affirm that delays are due to lack of resources and that no applicant is treated more favourably than others.</p>\n<p>With regards to pork, the process has been particular slow and restrictive due to SA rules on PRRS control. PL questionnaires have been validated in 2016, while discussions commenced in 2004. The final report is being completed and draft health certificates are being finalised. The queue currently comprises AT, SE and FI. AT has been waiting for more than four years. In the case of SE and FI (which are PRRS free according to OIE), SA has explained that declaration of freedom may have a positive impact only when the assessment starts but would not warrant fast-tracking because Sweden and Finland, being part of the EU market, are exposed to free circulation from other EU MS.</p>\n<p>Regarding poultry, Lithuania has applied for import of poultry and poultry products in 2012 and still waiting.</p>\n<p>Regarding beef, contrary to reassurances by SA, new health certificates are not yet available to Member States whose BSE status under OIE has improved and despite the fact that SA's cabinet has authorised DAFF to issue them. DAFF indicated further information might be required on use of animal protein and slaughterhouses. Application for IT Bresaola has been pending for a long time &ndash; IT has been number 8 on the list for 3 years now. The SA authorities consider Bresaola to be fresh meat &ndash; resulting from a dispute on the temperatures for treatment. DAFF requires 70 degrees, which also poses issues with mortadella.</p>\n<p>SA also insists that the EU needs to explain how BSE and other EU SPS controls are addressed in intra-community trade. SA requires information on how EU MS with different risk profiles manage imports among them and monitor exports to third countries which may ensue. As long as such explanation is provided, BSE status of all EU countries will be kept at levels which may be higher than the ones claimed individually under OIE and a declaration of freedom would have limited, if any impact. The SA authorities (DAFF) had told France that a mission to the EU would be sent to look into the issue.</p>\n<p>With regards to poultry, DAFF is refusing to resume imports from the NL after declaration of freedom from HPAI, contrary to past practice. In a letter to industry, reference is made to the \"plight of the (local poultry) industry\" (which has already led to the imposition of antidumping and provisional safeguard duties). It would thus appear that SPS issues are going to be used as trade defence measures. DAFF has announced intention to go to a fact finding mission to EU MS to verify freedom.</p>\n<p>**Although not adressed in a FTA, the EPA provides for enhanced co-operation on SPS matters and the establishment of an SPS co-operation committee**</p>",

            "description": "<p>SA authorities take several years to evaluate questionnaires used in the negotiations of import permits and health certificates by new applicants (such as in the case of a number of EU MS). For pork and other meats, SA operates a queue system with no indication of duration for the handling of the application. SA authorities affirm that delays are due to lack of resources and that no applicant is treated more favourably than others.</p>\n<p>With regards to pork, the process has been particular slow and restrictive due to SA rules on PRRS control. PL questionnaires have been validated in 2016, while discussions commenced in 2004. The final report is being completed and draft health certificates are being finalised. The queue currently comprises AT, SE and FI. AT has been waiting for more than four years. In the case of SE and FI (which are PRRS free according to OIE), SA has explained that declaration of freedom may have a positive impact only when the assessment starts but would not warrant fast-tracking because Sweden and Finland, being part of the EU market, are exposed to free circulation from other EU MS.</p>\n<p>Regarding poultry, Lithuania has applied for import of poultry and poultry products in 2012 and still waiting.</p>\n<p>Regarding beef, contrary to reassurances by SA, new health certificates are not yet available to Member States whose BSE status under OIE has improved and despite the fact that SA's cabinet has authorised DAFF to issue them. DAFF indicated further information might be required on use of animal protein and slaughterhouses. Application for IT Bresaola has been pending for a long time &ndash; IT has been number 8 on the list for 3 years now. The SA authorities consider Bresaola to be fresh meat &ndash; resulting from a dispute on the temperatures for treatment. DAFF requires 70 degrees, which also poses issues with mortadella.</p>\n<p>SA also insists that the EU needs to explain how BSE and other EU SPS controls are addressed in intra-community trade. SA requires information on how EU MS with different risk profiles manage imports among them and monitor exports to third countries which may ensue. As long as such explanation is provided, BSE status of all EU countries will be kept at levels which may be higher than the ones claimed individually under OIE and a declaration of freedom would have limited, if any impact. The SA authorities (DAFF) had told France that a mission to the EU would be sent to look into the issue.</p>\n<p>With regards to poultry, DAFF is refusing to resume imports from the NL after declaration of freedom from HPAI, contrary to past practice. In a letter to industry, reference is made to the \"plight of the (local poultry) industry\" (which has already led to the imposition of antidumping and provisional safeguard duties). It would thus appear that SPS issues are going to be used as trade defence measures. DAFF has announced intention to go to a fact finding mission to EU MS to verify freedom.</p>\n<p>**Although not adressed in a FTA, the EPA provides for enhanced co-operation on SPS matters and the establishment of an SPS co-operation committee**</p>",

In 2002, the EU and Japan agreed on a list of 46 priority food additives that the Japanese would approve in an accelerated pace. The prioriority list has been in practice been finalised in 2015&nbsp;without exemptions on food additives containing aluminium.&nbsp;&nbsp;The finalisation of the first priority list could have been seen as a first step towards the harmonisation of the Japanese legislation on food additives with international standards, in accordance with the provisions of the WTO SPS Agreement. However, beyond the first priority list there are still many more food additives not approved by Japan.</span></p>",

        "description": "<p>In 2004, the EU launched a WTO case against the US&nbsp;Government' support to the aerospace industry (DS353). The case&nbsp;relates to WTO-incompatible support&nbsp;to Boeing, on which a WTO panel issued its final public report on 31 March 2011, followed by the Appellate Body report on 12 March 2012. The EU&nbsp;challenged various US Federal, State and local subsidies benefitting Boeing, totalling -&nbsp;as confirmed by the AB report - <strong>USD 5-6 billion</strong> in WTO-inconsistent subsidies disbursed between 1989 and 2006. Moreover, further subsidies to be granted in the period 2006-2024 are estimated to amount to at least <strong>USD3.1 billion</strong>.&nbsp;More specifically:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>NASA has provided Boeing with more than <em>USD2.6 billion </em>in subsidies through eight NASA-funded federal research programmes through direct payments and free access to facilities, equipment and employees.&nbsp;The AB confirmed that these programmes provided subsidies in the form of a direct transfer of funds or the provision of goods and services by NASA to Boeing for which no fee is payable and for which Boeing acquired the commercial IP rights.</li>\n<li>The US Department of Defence (DOD) under its Research Development, Test and Evaluation programmes has transferred to Boeing, at no cost, dual use technology worth up to <em>USD1.2 billion </em>for direct use in Boeing's production of Large Civil Aircraft as well as free access to DOD's facilities.</li>\n<li>Boeing continued to benefit from <em>USD2.2 billion </em>in Foreign Sales Corporation export subsidies, despite previous WTO rulings that these are prohibited subsidies under WTO law.</li>\n<li>The City of Wichita (Kansas) granted almost <em>USD 500 million </em>in the form of tax abatements on Industrial Revenue Bonds between 1989 and 2006.</li>\n<li>Washington State tax breaks for the period 2006-24 amount to a subsidy value of close to <em>USD3.1 billion</em>. (Substitute Senate Bill 5952 of 9 November 2013 has since extended these tax breaks through 2040, at an estimated value of more than USD 8.7 billion).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>NASA and DOD research and development subsidies enabled Boeing to develop key technologies, without which it would not have been possible to launch the 787 \"Dreamliner\" in 2004.These research subsidies gave Boeing a competitive advantage causing Airbus to lose sales campaigns, thus losing sales of the A330 and A350 models (200-300 seat market) and threatening to lose its share of certain export markets. Even where it was able to make sales, it had to make them at reduced prices because of the presence of the subsidized 787 on the market.&nbsp;The AB has also confirmed that the Washington Tax subsidies and Foreign Sales Corporation subsidies, as well as the Wichita subsidies, enabled Boeing to beat Airbus to winning orders in the \"single aisle\" 100-200 seat market (Boeing 737 vs A320).&nbsp;Boeing's illegal subsidies adversely impacts sales, market share and prices of Airbus' A320, A320 neo, A330, A350XWB and the A380 families of Large Civil Aircraft (LCA).</p>",

            "description": "<p>In 2004, the EU launched a WTO case against the US&nbsp;Government' support to the aerospace industry (DS353). The case&nbsp;relates to WTO-incompatible support&nbsp;to Boeing, on which a WTO panel issued its final public report on 31 March 2011, followed by the Appellate Body report on 12 March 2012. The EU&nbsp;challenged various US Federal, State and local subsidies benefitting Boeing, totalling -&nbsp;as confirmed by the AB report - <strong>USD 5-6 billion</strong> in WTO-inconsistent subsidies disbursed between 1989 and 2006. Moreover, further subsidies to be granted in the period 2006-2024 are estimated to amount to at least <strong>USD3.1 billion</strong>.&nbsp;More specifically:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>NASA has provided Boeing with more than <em>USD2.6 billion </em>in subsidies through eight NASA-funded federal research programmes through direct payments and free access to facilities, equipment and employees.&nbsp;The AB confirmed that these programmes provided subsidies in the form of a direct transfer of funds or the provision of goods and services by NASA to Boeing for which no fee is payable and for which Boeing acquired the commercial IP rights.</li>\n<li>The US Department of Defence (DOD) under its Research Development, Test and Evaluation programmes has transferred to Boeing, at no cost, dual use technology worth up to <em>USD1.2 billion </em>for direct use in Boeing's production of Large Civil Aircraft as well as free access to DOD's facilities.</li>\n<li>Boeing continued to benefit from <em>USD2.2 billion </em>in Foreign Sales Corporation export subsidies, despite previous WTO rulings that these are prohibited subsidies under WTO law.</li>\n<li>The City of Wichita (Kansas) granted almost <em>USD 500 million </em>in the form of tax abatements on Industrial Revenue Bonds between 1989 and 2006.</li>\n<li>Washington State tax breaks for the period 2006-24 amount to a subsidy value of close to <em>USD3.1 billion</em>. (Substitute Senate Bill 5952 of 9 November 2013 has since extended these tax breaks through 2040, at an estimated value of more than USD 8.7 billion).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>NASA and DOD research and development subsidies enabled Boeing to develop key technologies, without which it would not have been possible to launch the 787 \"Dreamliner\" in 2004.These research subsidies gave Boeing a competitive advantage causing Airbus to lose sales campaigns, thus losing sales of the A330 and A350 models (200-300 seat market) and threatening to lose its share of certain export markets. Even where it was able to make sales, it had to make them at reduced prices because of the presence of the subsidized 787 on the market.&nbsp;The AB has also confirmed that the Washington Tax subsidies and Foreign Sales Corporation subsidies, as well as the Wichita subsidies, enabled Boeing to beat Airbus to winning orders in the \"single aisle\" 100-200 seat market (Boeing 737 vs A320).&nbsp;Boeing's illegal subsidies adversely impacts sales, market share and prices of Airbus' A320, A320 neo, A330, A350XWB and the A380 families of Large Civil Aircraft (LCA).</p>",

The scope of this mechanism is broad. The Turkish authorities put regularly in place communiqu&eacute;s through which different products enter in the scope of this measure.</p>\n<p>Prior to the import operation, and if the imported products' price is below the above mentioned threshold, the importer has to apply for a surveillance license to the Ministry of Economy. The application file contains information about the importer, the declarant (if different than the importer), the exporter, the producer and information about the imported product. Documents such as the original or notary-certified copy of the list of the authorized signatures of declarant, copies of the proforma invoice or the commercial invoice concerning the product to be imported should be provided with the application for surveillance certificate. However, additional information and documents may be requested by the Turkish authorities. This makes the measure similar to a non-automatic licence.</p>\n<p>Concerning textile products, there is a slightly different system for surveillance while it also results in replacement of a reference price if the invoice value is below the reference price calculated at the registration. At the beginning of 2009 the Communiqu&eacute; on registration requirements for textile and clothing product importers to Turkey was renewed and a requirement was added whereby all EU exporters to Turkey are required to register with the Turkish Exporters Association by filling in certain forms. Only once the registration is done, the export can take place. This measure is in force since 1 January 2009 and has since been renewed yearly. <br />&nbsp;</p>",

            "description": "<p>Import surveillance certificate regime consists in a requirement to obtain a surveillance license prior to the import of different products if their price is below a certain threshold defined by the authorities via different communiqu&eacute;s. The scope of this mechanism is broad. The Turkish authorities put regularly in place communiqu&eacute;s through which different products enter in the scope of this measure.</p>\n<p>Prior to the import operation, and if the imported products' price is below the above mentioned threshold, the importer has to apply for a surveillance license to the Ministry of Economy. The application file contains information about the importer, the declarant (if different than the importer), the exporter, the producer and information about the imported product. Documents such as the original or notary-certified copy of the list of the authorized signatures of declarant, copies of the proforma invoice or the commercial invoice concerning the product to be imported should be provided with the application for surveillance certificate. However, additional information and documents may be requested by the Turkish authorities. This makes the measure similar to a non-automatic licence.</p>\n<p>Concerning textile products, there is a slightly different system for surveillance while it also results in replacement of a reference price if the invoice value is below the reference price calculated at the registration. At the beginning of 2009 the Communiqu&eacute; on registration requirements for textile and clothing product importers to Turkey was renewed and a requirement was added whereby all EU exporters to Turkey are required to register with the Turkish Exporters Association by filling in certain forms. Only once the registration is done, the export can take place. This measure is in force since 1 January 2009 and has since been renewed yearly. <br />&nbsp;</p>",

The affected companies of the selected group of products for localisation were requested to submit their localisation plans until April 2016. The products for which localisation plans were rejected will be de-listed from the reimbursement list of the social security institution as of 2018. Moreover, certain pharmaceutical products shall only be produced locally after 2017. Those pharmaceuticals of foreign production will automatically lose their reimbursement status and costs will not be&nbsp;refunded by Thurkish health insurance even though they are prescribed.&nbsp;Such measures in favour of the protection of the local production will cause a significant loss of market share of foreign pharmaceutical companies.</p>",

        "description": "<p>On 13 January 2011, the Turkish Under-secretariat of Foreign Trade (later restructured as Ministry of Economy)&nbsp;published in the Official Gazette the Communiqu&eacute; on&nbsp;initiation of two&nbsp;safeguard investigations (no. 2011/1 and&nbsp; no. 2011/2). These Communiqu&eacute;s suggested the application of temporary measures by means of a decision&nbsp;increasing duties for goods belonging to HS codes 51.11, 51.12, 52.08, 52.09, 52.10, 52.11, 54.07, 54.08, 55.12, 55.13, 55.14, 55.15 , 55.16 and 61.01, 61.02, 61.03, 61.04, 61.05, 61.06, 61.07, 61.08, 61.09, 61.10, 61.12, 62.01, 62.02, 62.03, 62.04, 62.05, 62.06, 62.07, 62.08 , 62.11. This was followed by the Decision Number 2011/1476 of 24 March 2011 which established that additional customs duties would&nbsp;be provisionally&nbsp;collected. The measure was rendered definite as of 15 September 2011 not as a safeguard measure but in the form&nbsp; of tariff increases (MFN rates). Products originating in the EU of FTA partners of Turkey are not subject to additionatal duties. However, products originating in&nbsp;third countries are subject to additional duties when imported via the EU even if they were in free circulation in the EU.</p>\n<p>At that time, Turkey also extended the product range (headings included in chapters 30,52,53,58,59 and 60).</p>\n<p>The Turkish authorities decided (Decision no: 2012/3188 of 1 June 2012) that additional customs duty shall not be levied on goods originating in the countries that are included in a system of diagonal cumulation in the context of the FTAs to which Turkey is a party and imported via teh EU, provided that a proof of preferential status of the goods is submitted. In practical terms, this means that the additional duties will not be charged to goods originated in the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean area. Even though this decision was welcomed as a positive development by the EU, the situation remains the same for goods coming from countries not included in Decision 2012/3188, such as the ones to which Turkey has granted preferences under the Generalized System of Preferences.</p>\n<p>Over 630 tariff lines are affected by this measure and mainly the following: woven/knitted fabrics (semi-finished textiles) made from wool, cotton or (artificial and synthetic) man-made fibres; Ready-made apparel, such as coats, anoraks, pullovers, cardigans, vests, tracksuits, ski suits, swimwear, underwear, children&rsquo;s clothing, ties, bed and table linen. 54 % of all tariff lines in the textile and apparel sector (Section XI of the Combined Nomenclature) are covered by the measure.</p>\n<p>After that, additional custom duties have been imposed since 2014 on a broad range of other products such as footwear, tyres, furniture, home appliances cosmetics, stationery products, certain steel products, accessories for vehicles and miscellaneous products etc. covered by 17 different decisions.</p>\n<p>This barrier is particularly important for the footwear industry.</p>\n<p>Additional customs duties of 10%, 30% and 50% on certain footwear products have been applied&nbsp;since August 2014. Footwear originating from EU or FTA partners is not subject to additional duties, but products originating from countries benefiting from GSP preferences are.</p>\n<p>On 1 September, Turkey extended the scope of additional duties on footwear by extending it to additional tariff codes 6406 1090 and 6406 9030. Additional duty of 20% will be applied to the countries excluding EU, EFTA and other FTA partners.</p>",

            "description": "<p>On 13 January 2011, the Turkish Under-secretariat of Foreign Trade (later restructured as Ministry of Economy)&nbsp;published in the Official Gazette the Communiqu&eacute; on&nbsp;initiation of two&nbsp;safeguard investigations (no. 2011/1 and&nbsp; no. 2011/2). These Communiqu&eacute;s suggested the application of temporary measures by means of a decision&nbsp;increasing duties for goods belonging to HS codes 51.11, 51.12, 52.08, 52.09, 52.10, 52.11, 54.07, 54.08, 55.12, 55.13, 55.14, 55.15 , 55.16 and 61.01, 61.02, 61.03, 61.04, 61.05, 61.06, 61.07, 61.08, 61.09, 61.10, 61.12, 62.01, 62.02, 62.03, 62.04, 62.05, 62.06, 62.07, 62.08 , 62.11. This was followed by the Decision Number 2011/1476 of 24 March 2011 which established that additional customs duties would&nbsp;be provisionally&nbsp;collected. The measure was rendered definite as of 15 September 2011 not as a safeguard measure but in the form&nbsp; of tariff increases (MFN rates). Products originating in the EU of FTA partners of Turkey are not subject to additionatal duties. However, products originating in&nbsp;third countries are subject to additional duties when imported via the EU even if they were in free circulation in the EU.</p>\n<p>At that time, Turkey also extended the product range (headings included in chapters 30,52,53,58,59 and 60).</p>\n<p>The Turkish authorities decided (Decision no: 2012/3188 of 1 June 2012) that additional customs duty shall not be levied on goods originating in the countries that are included in a system of diagonal cumulation in the context of the FTAs to which Turkey is a party and imported via teh EU, provided that a proof of preferential status of the goods is submitted. In practical terms, this means that the additional duties will not be charged to goods originated in the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean area. Even though this decision was welcomed as a positive development by the EU, the situation remains the same for goods coming from countries not included in Decision 2012/3188, such as the ones to which Turkey has granted preferences under the Generalized System of Preferences.</p>\n<p>Over 630 tariff lines are affected by this measure and mainly the following: woven/knitted fabrics (semi-finished textiles) made from wool, cotton or (artificial and synthetic) man-made fibres; Ready-made apparel, such as coats, anoraks, pullovers, cardigans, vests, tracksuits, ski suits, swimwear, underwear, children&rsquo;s clothing, ties, bed and table linen. 54 % of all tariff lines in the textile and apparel sector (Section XI of the Combined Nomenclature) are covered by the measure.</p>\n<p>After that, additional custom duties have been imposed since 2014 on a broad range of other products such as footwear, tyres, furniture, home appliances cosmetics, stationery products, certain steel products, accessories for vehicles and miscellaneous products etc. covered by 17 different decisions.</p>\n<p>This barrier is particularly important for the footwear industry.</p>\n<p>Additional customs duties of 10%, 30% and 50% on certain footwear products have been applied&nbsp;since August 2014. Footwear originating from EU or FTA partners is not subject to additional duties, but products originating from countries benefiting from GSP preferences are.</p>\n<p>On 1 September, Turkey extended the scope of additional duties on footwear by extending it to additional tariff codes 6406 1090 and 6406 9030. Additional duty of 20% will be applied to the countries excluding EU, EFTA and other FTA partners.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Resolution ARCSA - D-067-2015-GGG - RO 21 establishing the requirements for registering an imported product which entered into force in December 2015 (not notified) slightly relaxed registration procedures but importers are still asked to provide a very long list of documents which is not standard international practice. In practice this means that it takes approximately two years to register one brand while registration procedures for locally produced spirits take on average two weeks.</p>\n<p>The following documents are required to register one brand:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Power of attorney from the manufacturer to the distributor authorizing them to register the product on their behalf.</li>\n<li>Free Sale Certificate.</li>\n<li>Certificate of Method of Manufacture.</li>\n<li>Certificate of explanation for lot code.</li>\n<li>Safety certificate from suppliers (for bottles and glasses). Note: Generally, it should suffice for the manufacturer of the final product to guarantee safety of all its components, in this case, the authorities require the certificates to be submitted from the manufacturer of each component, and this is an unusual requirement which delays the process considerably.</li>\n<li>Labels of the product.</li>\n<li>Certification of the type of product being registered and the applicable regulation in Ecuador.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ecuador also formally requested (without any prior notification) that imported spirits include quantitative unit ingredient declaration which means that every constituent has now to be followed by a %. In the case of whisky this would be for water, alcohol and caramel. Although EU spirits producers have demonstrated that the amount of caramel colour is marginal and hence does not alter the volume of the other two components (60% water, 40% whisky), we are now under the obligation to declare an additional 0.05% of caramel which is erroneous from a composition perspective.</p>\n<p>Ecuador also started to question the way ingredients are currently listed on the certificates and the labels, as they claim that &ldquo;whisky&rdquo; is not an ingredient but the final product. Given that whisky is a single ingredient product, ingredients listing should not be required where the product name and the ingredient list are the same (e.g. whisky) as it is clearly stated on the pack &ndash; the &ldquo;ingredients: Whisky&rdquo; requirement on the back is thus a burdensome repetition that does not provide any additional information to the consumer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

            "description": "<p>Resolution ARCSA - D-067-2015-GGG - RO 21 establishing the requirements for registering an imported product which entered into force in December 2015 (not notified) slightly relaxed registration procedures but importers are still asked to provide a very long list of documents which is not standard international practice. In practice this means that it takes approximately two years to register one brand while registration procedures for locally produced spirits take on average two weeks.</p>\n<p>The following documents are required to register one brand:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Power of attorney from the manufacturer to the distributor authorizing them to register the product on their behalf.</li>\n<li>Free Sale Certificate.</li>\n<li>Certificate of Method of Manufacture.</li>\n<li>Certificate of explanation for lot code.</li>\n<li>Safety certificate from suppliers (for bottles and glasses). Note: Generally, it should suffice for the manufacturer of the final product to guarantee safety of all its components, in this case, the authorities require the certificates to be submitted from the manufacturer of each component, and this is an unusual requirement which delays the process considerably.</li>\n<li>Labels of the product.</li>\n<li>Certification of the type of product being registered and the applicable regulation in Ecuador.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ecuador also formally requested (without any prior notification) that imported spirits include quantitative unit ingredient declaration which means that every constituent has now to be followed by a %. In the case of whisky this would be for water, alcohol and caramel. Although EU spirits producers have demonstrated that the amount of caramel colour is marginal and hence does not alter the volume of the other two components (60% water, 40% whisky), we are now under the obligation to declare an additional 0.05% of caramel which is erroneous from a composition perspective.</p>\n<p>Ecuador also started to question the way ingredients are currently listed on the certificates and the labels, as they claim that &ldquo;whisky&rdquo; is not an ingredient but the final product. Given that whisky is a single ingredient product, ingredients listing should not be required where the product name and the ingredient list are the same (e.g. whisky) as it is clearly stated on the pack &ndash; the &ldquo;ingredients: Whisky&rdquo; requirement on the back is thus a burdensome repetition that does not provide any additional information to the consumer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

This notification mentions Decree 69/2009, which states that a control seal regime is about to be developed. The notification omits to mention Decree 59/2016, which lays out the rules and practicalities surrounding the new control stamp regime.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The industry has two major concerns regarding the new regime:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The proposed date of implementation of the new control seal regime is retrospective (14<sup>th</sup> September 2016), and is the same as the date of publication of the rules surrounding the control stamp regime in Decree 59/2016. It seems the measure was already in force at the time of the WTO Notification.</li>\n<li>The control stamp regime in Decree 59/2016 does not comply with WTO law. It discriminates overtly through different prices charged for control stamps to imported and domestic producers of &lsquo;like&rsquo; beverage categories. The price differences applied in Euros, per 1000 stamps, are as follows:</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"162\">\n<p><strong>Alcoholic beverages</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"158\">\n<p><strong>Spirit drinks</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"142\">\n<p><strong>Beer</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"158\">\n<p><strong>Wine</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"162\">\n<p><strong>Domestic</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"158\">\n<p>15.30</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"142\">\n<p>6.85</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"158\">\n<p>12.25</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"162\">\n<p><strong>Imported</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"158\">\n<p>29.68</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"142\">\n<p>9.57</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"158\">\n<p>27.07</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>A final concern exists with the lack of flexibility in the application of the control seal. Decree 59/2016 only permits the application of control stamps &lsquo;before importation&rsquo;. This restriction on company practices is unnecessary, and Mozambique should also permit the application of the control seals in bonded warehouses in Mozambique, at no extra cost to itself.</li>\n</ul>",

The notification omits to mention Decree 59/2016, which lays out the rules and practicalities surrounding the new control stamp regime.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The industry has two major concerns regarding the new regime:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The proposed date of implementation of the new control seal regime is retrospective (14<sup>th</sup> September 2016), and is the same as the date of publication of the rules surrounding the control stamp regime in Decree 59/2016. It seems the measure was already in force at the time of the WTO Notification.</li>\n<li>The control stamp regime in Decree 59/2016 does not comply with WTO law. It discriminates overtly through different prices charged for control stamps to imported and domestic producers of &lsquo;like&rsquo; beverage categories. The price differences applied in Euros, per 1000 stamps, are as follows:</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"162\">\n<p><strong>Alcoholic beverages</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"158\">\n<p><strong>Spirit drinks</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"142\">\n<p><strong>Beer</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"158\">\n<p><strong>Wine</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"162\">\n<p><strong>Domestic</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"158\">\n<p>15.30</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"142\">\n<p>6.85</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"158\">\n<p>12.25</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"162\">\n<p><strong>Imported</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"158\">\n<p>29.68</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"142\">\n<p>9.57</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"158\">\n<p>27.07</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>A final concern exists with the lack of flexibility in the application of the control seal. Decree 59/2016 only permits the application of control stamps &lsquo;before importation&rsquo;. This restriction on company practices is unnecessary, and Mozambique should also permit the application of the control seals in bonded warehouses in Mozambique, at no extra cost to itself.</li>\n</ul>",

It states, among others, that import and export of food shall only be done in accordance with national food needs. It further stipulates labelling requirements that are unclear (&rsquo;during entry&rsquo;) and notes a government &rsquo;obligation&rsquo; to stabilise food prices. Article 34 mandates that \"staple foods\" can only be exported if domestic consumption is fulfilled and national food reserves are sufficient. Food can only be exported after considering domestic food consumption and national interests. Article 36 mandates that food can only be imported if domestic production is insufficient or the item cannot be produced domestically. Articles 46/51/55/56/108- Allows and notes a government \"obligation\" to stabilize the supply and price of \"staple foods\". This can be done, among other ways, by price fixing, provision and management of food supply and food trading, establishment of tax/tariff policy in favour of national interests, and regulation of import and export.

Indonesia requires absence of a number of diseases in a country or establishment for which OIE does not consider trade measures necessary.

An application is pending since 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada, the United States and Mexico have been working to align the North American regional standard on the movement of potatoes into a NAPPO member country (RSPM 3) with the IPPC standard ISPM 33.&nbsp; This process is still ongoing.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, the import of field grown seed potatoes, in vitro plantlets, microtubers, minitubers and cuttings and other potato propagative materials from markets other than the United States are imported into Canada through post entry quarantine (PEQ).&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics show that this import procedure from Canada is not feasible for European exports of seed potatoes&nbsp;as it is considered too trade restrictive.&nbsp;The details of access are contained in CFIA policy D-98-01 (<a href=\"http://www.inspection.gc.ca/plants/plant-pests-invasive-species/directives/potatoes/d-98-01/eng/1312247584545/1312247683833\">http://www.inspection.gc.ca/plants/plant-pests-invasive-species/directives/potatoes/d-98-01/eng/1312247584545/1312247683833</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ISPM 33 provides the option of an alternative means to trade micropropagative materials and minitubers.&nbsp; The new draft of RSPM 3 will refer to this process as post entry monitoring (PEM) and will rely on an integrated systems approach to ensure the production of pest free potato micropropagative materials and minitubers.&nbsp; PEM would reduce the timelines for obtaining the potato germplasm for propagation.&nbsp; Post entry quarantine will continue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At present discussions continue in Canada to align its policy with ISPM 33 and at the same time the final requirements will also need to be consistent with the final version of RSPM 3 (NAPPO).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite several requests from the EU, Canada has not been able to provide an indicative timeline on when these&nbsp;alignment procedures towards ISPM 33 will be finalised and thus&nbsp;imports&nbsp;into Canda of seed potatoes from interested EU Member States following the ISPM 33 approach remains&nbsp;blocked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to&nbsp;the EU,&nbsp;a swift treatment of this application should be feasible, given the negligible risk of the good.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The EU continues to raise this issue with Canada at different fora and expects that the pending application process for the imports of seed potatoes into Canada from the EU could&nbsp;be finalised without any further delay.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Although China&rsquo;s WTO commitments allow foreign participation up to 49%, basic telecommunication licenses have only been granted to the three state-owned telecom operators (China Telecom, China Unicom, China Mobile)+ CITIC.

The VAS licence application process is cumbersome and limited in scope to certain services.

On 8 February 2014, MIIT has released new regulations stating that China&rsquo;s burgeoning mobile virtual network operators will not be allowed to invest in the construction of mobile network infrastructure. MVNOs wishing to use the aforementioned infrastructure must purchase or rent network facilities provided from telecom operators that have already obtained approval to operate basic telecommunications services.

It would be useful if China would clarify with implementing rules, the conditions under which express delivery companies are allowed to continue carrying out their operations without introducing any further restrictions or burdensome requirements especially via licensing procedures.<br />The need for the express business operation permit, which is required under the Postal Law and by other relevant regulations, will bring huge burdens for enterprises and become the largest hindrance and bottleneck for industry development.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>",

Domestic non-special cosmetics only need to notify at provincial FDA. Testing by approved laboratories may be replaced by in-house safety assessment. Animal testing is also not required.

        "description": "<p>China classifies investment as being foreign or domestic. This approach is designed to serve industrial policies by placing conditionality on the opening of markets to foreign investment.</p>\n<p>Foreign direct investment (FDI) in China is subject to a complex regulatory regime. One of its key elements is the Catalogue of Industries for Guiding Foreign Investment, the so-called Foreign Investment Catalogue, adopted jointly by NDRC and MOFCOM. The Catalogue classifies investments in all key sectors according to three main categories: encouraged, restricted and prohibited. It should be noted, however, that the Catalogue is not exhaustive neither in terms of listing all existing barriers to foreign investment nor in terms of including all economic sectors.</p>\n<p>Since the Foreign Investment Catalogue was first issued in 1995, it has been one of the most fundamental legal documents regulating foreign investment in China.</p>\n<p>On 8 October 2016, a nation-wide reform on foreign investment was launched resulting in the removal of the requirement to obtain approval from MOFCOM or its local branches for projects which do not fall within a 'negative list'. (A change from pre-approval to record-filing system).</p>\n<p>Despite announcements made, the State Council failed however to publicize a separate negative list on the same date. Instead, reference continued to be made to the current Foreign Investment Catalogue (2015 Revision).</p>\n<p>Under the Foreign Investment Catalogue (2015 Revision) and all its previous versions, industries were classified under the following categories: (a) encouraged, (b) restricted and (c) prohibited. The encouraged category covers industries in which foreign investment is provided with the greatest flexibility and where the governmental interference is the lowest. Industries in this sector can also be subject to tax and other investment incentives. This category includes a number of high-tech and advanced manufacturing sectors, such as the for example aerospace or pollution control. The restricted category covers industries in which foreign investment is subject to a higher level of government scrutiny, limitations on the choice of corporate forms (such as mandatory joint ventures) and ownership ceilings. This category includes a number of sub-sectors within the services sector, including banking and insurance. Foreign investment in sectors listed under the prohibited category is simply not permitted at all. This category includes for example the domestic postal service. At the same time, industries which are not expressly listed in the Catalogue are deemed to be permitted.</p>\n<p>Despite its importance, the Catalogue should not be considered the sole reference for foreign investors. Bans, limitations and additional requirements may also result from other mechanisms and laws, such as the National Security Review, the Anti-Monopoly Law or the Joint Venture Law. Other less tangible barriers exist due to cumbersome administrative and licensing procedures as well as local protectionism which can block potential investments altogether. This can be the case also if a given industry is included among the encouraged ones in the Catalogue&mdash;this explains why EU companies continue to feel significant restrictions even though some sectors are nominally opened to foreign investment.</p>\n<p>Since its first promulgation in 1995, the Catalogue was reviewed six times. A new revised version of the Foreign Investment Catalogue was published for comments in December 2016. Though the draft 2017 Revision saw some limited opening of sectors, albeit both narrow and specific, it did not result in any significant improvements for foreign companies. The kinds of limitations to investment that are listed in the Catalogue range from obligations to invest through a joint venture, local content requirements and foreign shareholding requirements, to restrictions on senior managers and members of the board of directors and to limitations to the type of establishment.</p>\n<p>In the draft 2017 Revision of the Foreign Investment Catalogue, and in order to implement the recent reform on foreign investment, the Draft groups industries under the following two main headings: (a) encouraged and (b) negative list. The negative list section is further divided into three categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Industries under the encouraged category but subject to restrictions on foreign equity holding;</li>\n<li>Industries under the restricted category; and</li>\n<li>Industries under the prohibited category.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a foreign investor would like to know whether its investment falls within the negative list (and if so, requires MOFCOM approval), it should refer to this negative list.</p>\n<p>Since spring of 2016, NDRC has been piloting in several provinces (nation-wide launch is foreseen for 1 January 2018) a so-called Market Access Negative list. While this list is equally applicable to domestic and foreign investments, it contains another layer of restrictions (thus beyond the Foreign Investment Catalogue) on the investments foreign companies can make in China. Even if the industrial sectors might be the same in Foreign investment Catalogue (FIC) and the domestic Market Access Negative list, the restrictions applicable are not the same. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Foreign Investment Catalogue is supplemented by a Central and Western China Foreign Investment Catalogue which lists additional encouraged activities and sectors for projects in Central and Western China (China&rsquo;s central and western regions comprise the following provinces and areas: Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia and Xinjiang).</p>\n<p>In addition to this, the China State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) has released a list of industries where broad investment restrictions will apply and that should remain largely state-owned. For example, the State should solely own, or have a majority share in enterprises engaged in power generation and distribution, oil, petrochemicals and natural gas, telecommunications and armaments.</p>\n<p>Many other laws contain restrictions or conditions on foreign investment including technology transfer requirements.</p>\n<p>Foreign companies can invest in China through three vehicles: equity joint ventures (EJV), contractual joint ventures (CJV) and wholly foreign owned enterprise (WFOE). This means that Foreign companies have to take a different legal form than domestic companies which are subject to the China company law, and are subject to different and more stringent conditions, e.g. on the nationality of the CEO or the number of foreign national in the board of directors. We believe that foreign and domestic companies should all be subject to one and single law: the China company law.</p>\n<p>Apart from direct restrictions to investment, companies also suffer more indirect barriers due to measures such as targeted enforcement, local discretion or retroactive application of laws as well as unclear or discriminatory licensing procedures. Also, in approval processes, the requirements for foreign investors are often more burdensome, not transparent or known in advance. In 2014, the Commission has commissioned a study on investment restrictions in China (&rsquo;Measures and practices restraining foreign investment in China&rsquo;, 10.08.2014), which is published on DG Trade&rsquo;s website.</p>",

In the run-up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the Government of Japan (GoJ) has set a very ambitious target of welcoming 40 m visitors (up from 24m in 2016). The majority of these visitors will travel through Tokyo&rsquo;s two airports (Narita and Haneda). Haneda, the closest to downtown Tokyo and preferred entry point, is very busy and slot constrained. Very Large Aircraft (VLA) such as the A380 can help the GoJ meet its 40m visitor&rsquo;s target, by improving the utilisation of existing slots, with the deployment of more seats per flight. Moreover, the introduction of new technology to increase aircraft movements is available.</p>\n<p>To date, the Japanese Civil Aviation Administration (JCAB) has not allowed, despite repeated requests and factual safety demonstrations, access to the Airbus A380 aircraft to Tokyo Haneda airport during daytime.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JCAB claim that the increased separation necessary for wake-vortex issues at take-off and landing required between the A380 and other aircraft makes it impractical to operate at Haneda because of disruption to traffic flow in this already congested airport.</p>",

            "description": "<p>For Japan, air connectivity is important because it accounts for up to 98 per cent of tourism inflow. In the run-up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the Government of Japan (GoJ) has set a very ambitious target of welcoming 40 m visitors (up from 24m in 2016). The majority of these visitors will travel through Tokyo&rsquo;s two airports (Narita and Haneda). Haneda, the closest to downtown Tokyo and preferred entry point, is very busy and slot constrained. Very Large Aircraft (VLA) such as the A380 can help the GoJ meet its 40m visitor&rsquo;s target, by improving the utilisation of existing slots, with the deployment of more seats per flight. Moreover, the introduction of new technology to increase aircraft movements is available.</p>\n<p>To date, the Japanese Civil Aviation Administration (JCAB) has not allowed, despite repeated requests and factual safety demonstrations, access to the Airbus A380 aircraft to Tokyo Haneda airport during daytime.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JCAB claim that the increased separation necessary for wake-vortex issues at take-off and landing required between the A380 and other aircraft makes it impractical to operate at Haneda because of disruption to traffic flow in this already congested airport.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Long a hold out amongst advanced economies, Australia has finally committed to join the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), submitting its initial offer in July 2015 and a revised offer in October 2016. This provides an opportunity to seek to address outstanding access issues, particularly at the sub-central level (the Australian States and Territories) where non-discrimination has not been adopted as a key principle, and some discriminatory measures remain in place.</p>\n<p>At the central (Commonwealth) level, the Australian Government Procurement market is largely non-discriminatory and transparent, governed by the Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPR) which follow a devolved model were Chief Executives of each government entity manage their own procurement within a centrally prescribed framework. This framework is built around the core principle of achieving value for money through competition (i.e. non-discrimination); efficient, effective and ethical procurement; accountability and transparency; consideration of risk; and conducting a process commensurate with the scale and scope of the procurement. Additional requirements exist for procurement above certain thresholds, but a number of \"sensitives\" sectors &ndash; including property and accommodation, motor vehicles, research and development services, defence-related procurement, blood plasma products, business servicing the disabled, and indigenously-owned SMEs - are exempted from these additional requirements (these sectors are also generally exempt from coverage of the procurement chapters in Australia&rsquo;s FTAs). The CPRs also include a target for non-corporate government agencies to source at least 10 per cent of procurement by value from SMEs (defined as an Australian or New Zealand firm with fewer than 200 full-time equivalent employees). Australian officials argue this does not imply any discrimination in favour of SMEs, as the CPRs elsewhere make clear that SMEs will win government business only if they are competitive. In practice, SMEs' share of Commonwealth procurement far exceeds the 10% target (34.4% of total value for 2013-14, 32% for 2012-13, 29% for 2011-12), and therefore the question of discriminating in favour of SMEs to meet the target would not seem to arise.</p>\n<p>In November 2016 the Australian Finance Minster announced a number changes to the CPRs to come into effect in March next year. In particular, new rules having been introduced requiring tenderers to provide evidence that they have the capability to meet the Australian standard applicable for goods or services being procured, and mandating Commonwealth officials consider the economic benefit of the procurement to the Australian economy (for procurement above A$4&nbsp; million). The Australian Governments asserts that these changes are compliant with the procurement provisions of Australia's FTAs.</p>\n<p>At the sub-central level, State and Territory governments each have their own policies and legislation governing procurement. While a number of the state government procurement regimes have been moving towards devolved and more transparent and simplified systems similar to arrangements at the federal level, they have not adopted non-discrimination as a key principle, and retain measures aimed at boosting domestic suppliers and local content, particularly SMEs. Sub-central governments may require suppliers to meet a minimum local content in public procurement for \"strategic\" projects (e.g. Victoria) or may impose weighting for local content criterion in tender evaluation (Victoria, South Australia). Western Australia retains a price preference scheme in which it imposes surcharges on goods with a certain proportion of imported content, which works to the advantage of Australian and NZ suppliers. WA Government agencies, when comparing bids, apply a 20% price preference to the portion of a bid that comprises a good, service or items that have been sourced from overseas, excluding New Zealand. However, countries possessing free trade agreements under which state governments are bound by procurement provisions (currently New Zealand, the United States, Chile, Korea and Japan) are excluded from these schemes and requirements.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

            "description": "<p>Long a hold out amongst advanced economies, Australia has finally committed to join the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), submitting its initial offer in July 2015 and a revised offer in October 2016. This provides an opportunity to seek to address outstanding access issues, particularly at the sub-central level (the Australian States and Territories) where non-discrimination has not been adopted as a key principle, and some discriminatory measures remain in place.</p>\n<p>At the central (Commonwealth) level, the Australian Government Procurement market is largely non-discriminatory and transparent, governed by the Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPR) which follow a devolved model were Chief Executives of each government entity manage their own procurement within a centrally prescribed framework. This framework is built around the core principle of achieving value for money through competition (i.e. non-discrimination); efficient, effective and ethical procurement; accountability and transparency; consideration of risk; and conducting a process commensurate with the scale and scope of the procurement. Additional requirements exist for procurement above certain thresholds, but a number of \"sensitives\" sectors &ndash; including property and accommodation, motor vehicles, research and development services, defence-related procurement, blood plasma products, business servicing the disabled, and indigenously-owned SMEs - are exempted from these additional requirements (these sectors are also generally exempt from coverage of the procurement chapters in Australia&rsquo;s FTAs). The CPRs also include a target for non-corporate government agencies to source at least 10 per cent of procurement by value from SMEs (defined as an Australian or New Zealand firm with fewer than 200 full-time equivalent employees). Australian officials argue this does not imply any discrimination in favour of SMEs, as the CPRs elsewhere make clear that SMEs will win government business only if they are competitive. In practice, SMEs' share of Commonwealth procurement far exceeds the 10% target (34.4% of total value for 2013-14, 32% for 2012-13, 29% for 2011-12), and therefore the question of discriminating in favour of SMEs to meet the target would not seem to arise.</p>\n<p>In November 2016 the Australian Finance Minster announced a number changes to the CPRs to come into effect in March next year. In particular, new rules having been introduced requiring tenderers to provide evidence that they have the capability to meet the Australian standard applicable for goods or services being procured, and mandating Commonwealth officials consider the economic benefit of the procurement to the Australian economy (for procurement above A$4&nbsp; million). The Australian Governments asserts that these changes are compliant with the procurement provisions of Australia's FTAs.</p>\n<p>At the sub-central level, State and Territory governments each have their own policies and legislation governing procurement. While a number of the state government procurement regimes have been moving towards devolved and more transparent and simplified systems similar to arrangements at the federal level, they have not adopted non-discrimination as a key principle, and retain measures aimed at boosting domestic suppliers and local content, particularly SMEs. Sub-central governments may require suppliers to meet a minimum local content in public procurement for \"strategic\" projects (e.g. Victoria) or may impose weighting for local content criterion in tender evaluation (Victoria, South Australia). Western Australia retains a price preference scheme in which it imposes surcharges on goods with a certain proportion of imported content, which works to the advantage of Australian and NZ suppliers. WA Government agencies, when comparing bids, apply a 20% price preference to the portion of a bid that comprises a good, service or items that have been sourced from overseas, excluding New Zealand. However, countries possessing free trade agreements under which state governments are bound by procurement provisions (currently New Zealand, the United States, Chile, Korea and Japan) are excluded from these schemes and requirements.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "description": "<p>Public procurement, at least at federal government level, gives preference to goods of domestic origin.&nbsp;The law requires the federal government and its agencies/SOEs and concessionaries of public services etc.,&nbsp;to give preference in their purchases and procurements to buying and leasing goods of domestic origin. Domestic suppliers receive a preference of 7% on their contracts if the bid is made by an SME, or 5% if the bid comes from an enterprise of another kind. Since 2012 all companies with exporting activities, irrespective of their SME status, are also given a preference margin of 7%. In addition, for certain sectors (such as fuel purchasing) it is obligatory to use national suppliers. Different preferences for local suppliers were introduced in the tenders for renewable energy launched by the Ministry of Energy in 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>This trade barrier has been in place in different forms for a long time, except in the period between 1991 and 2001. A \"Buy Argentine\" legislation was applicable until its suspension in 1991. In 2001 the Economic Emergency Law, No. 23.697 reintroduced a preference in favour of domestic industry for the procurement and contracting of goods, works and services by public entities, with a maximum of 10% domestic preference in the case of goods. This provision was subsequently repealed by Law No. 25.551 &ldquo;Compre Trabajo Argentino&rdquo; (Buy Argentine Labour), which established the system of preferences for goods of domestic origin currently applicable.</p>\n<p>Through Decree 893/2012, adopted on 14 June 2012, a preference margin of 7% was added for suppliers with exporting activities.</p>\n<p>A good is considered as \"domestic\" when it is produced or extracted in Argentina, provided the cost of the imported raw materials, inputs or nationalized materials does not exceed 40% of the gross production value. In the case of procurement for inputs, materials, raw materials or capital goods to be used in the production of goods or the provision of services, domestic preference will be given when, in otherwise similar bids, the prices are equal to or below those of foreign goods. When a bid involving goods of foreign origin is accompanied by a payment or financing plan of some kind, bidders offering goods of domestic origin may request funding from the Bank for Investment and External Trade (BICE) to put them on an equal financial footing.</p>\n<p>In April 2017 a draft legislative project called ' Buy National \" was submitted by the Argentinian Ministry of Industry to Congress. The project aims at establishing a priority for products of national origin in public procurement with an aim to &nbsp;foster&nbsp; employment and better participation of national suppliers to GP procedures, including SMEs. The project's most problematic provisions are : (1) raising the &nbsp;existing preference in government procurement for SMEs and for other industries: the project foresees that existing margin preference in government procurement would increase &nbsp;from&nbsp; 7% to 12% for small and medium enterprises and from 5% to 8% for other enterprises, and (2) creating incentives to prefer&nbsp; products produced locally. The project foresees that in case of national tendering, it is mandatory for foreign enterprises to&nbsp; enter into transfer of technologies and other cooperation agreements with local enterprises.</p>",

Different preferences for local suppliers were introduced in the tenders for renewable energy launched by the Ministry of Energy in 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>This trade barrier has been in place in different forms for a long time, except in the period between 1991 and 2001. A \"Buy Argentine\" legislation was applicable until its suspension in 1991. In 2001 the Economic Emergency Law, No. 23.697 reintroduced a preference in favour of domestic industry for the procurement and contracting of goods, works and services by public entities, with a maximum of 10% domestic preference in the case of goods. This provision was subsequently repealed by Law No. 25.551 &ldquo;Compre Trabajo Argentino&rdquo; (Buy Argentine Labour), which established the system of preferences for goods of domestic origin currently applicable.</p>\n<p>Through Decree 893/2012, adopted on 14 June 2012, a preference margin of 7% was added for suppliers with exporting activities.</p>\n<p>A good is considered as \"domestic\" when it is produced or extracted in Argentina, provided the cost of the imported raw materials, inputs or nationalized materials does not exceed 40% of the gross production value. In the case of procurement for inputs, materials, raw materials or capital goods to be used in the production of goods or the provision of services, domestic preference will be given when, in otherwise similar bids, the prices are equal to or below those of foreign goods. When a bid involving goods of foreign origin is accompanied by a payment or financing plan of some kind, bidders offering goods of domestic origin may request funding from the Bank for Investment and External Trade (BICE) to put them on an equal financial footing.</p>\n<p>In April 2017 a draft legislative project called ' Buy National \" was submitted by the Argentinian Ministry of Industry to Congress. The project aims at establishing a priority for products of national origin in public procurement with an aim to &nbsp;foster&nbsp; employment and better participation of national suppliers to GP procedures, including SMEs. The project's most problematic provisions are : (1) raising the &nbsp;existing preference in government procurement for SMEs and for other industries: the project foresees that existing margin preference in government procurement would increase &nbsp;from&nbsp; 7% to 12% for small and medium enterprises and from 5% to 8% for other enterprises, and (2) creating incentives to prefer&nbsp; products produced locally. The project foresees that in case of national tendering, it is mandatory for foreign enterprises to&nbsp; enter into transfer of technologies and other cooperation agreements with local enterprises.</p>",

As previous mechanisms, each one has a different exchange rate for foreign currencies, mainly the US dollar (USD) per bolivars (VEF), depending on the priority of the products and the purpose of the transaction. DIPRO is a primary exchange rate of VEF/USD 10 that applies only to essential imports, such as medicines and food, as well raw materials for production, pensions for Venezuelans living abroad, and national students at academic institutions abroad. This market covers 93% of the exchange operations on daily basis and it is administrated by Foreign Trade Centre (CENCOEX). In contrast, DICOM feeds only 7% residual of the exchange market and it is administrated by Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) with a controlled floating exchange rate that applies for all non-essential imports.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The procedure for obtaining foreign currency under DIPRO continues to be very burdensome. Due the officially available foreign currency is far less than the demand a considerable number of companies have arrears with their suppliers abroad and therefore are lacking inputs for their production.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also foreign investors in Venezuela are facing problems to convert their local earnings into USD or EUR. Venezuela have had six different exchange systems, some of them superposed, under the Foreign Exchange Control still in force during its 14 years of operation (CADIVI, SITME, SICAD I, SICAD II, SIMADI and from March 09, 2016 DIPRO-DICOM) which limits seriously the investor access to the very restricted foreign currency markets and with complex barriers for investors to handle.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The current regime, the Complementary Exchange System (DICOM) that works with a floating rate, was updated in May 2017 to operate through 8 currency auctions a month. The offer of each auction has been around USD 25M, adapted to the low liquidity of the Central Bank. The price of bidding was set, initially, in a fixed range between 1,800 to 2,200 VEF/USD, but it was rapidly increased to 2,010-2,640 (16 June 2017).

Zeroing has two main effects on EU exporters. Firstly, it increases the amount of duty paid on those goods exported to the US, thus reducing their competitiveness. Secondly, by increasing the rate of anti-dumping duty, it deters many exporters from exporting to the US at all. <br />The US system: Following a new investigation, the US imposes an anti-dumping duty per exporter and, upon request, revises the level of the duty every year in a so-called &rsquo;administrative review&rsquo;. Such reviews involve a new calculation of dumping on the imports which enter the US during the previous year. For example, if an anti-dumping duty is imposed on 1 January 2008, the first review will begin in January 2009, covering imports into the US during the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2008. In most cases, it is these reviews which determine how much anti-dumping duty is actually collected, as the duty rate from the original investigation is replaced by the rate found in the first administrative review. In these circumstances, the only relevance of the dumping margin in the original investigation is to determine whether it is above the minimum threshold of 2% which enables the US to impose a duty in the first place.<br />It is important to note that in reviews, the US can either increase or decrease the level of anti-dumping duty. This contrasts with the EC system, in which anti-dumping duties can only be refunded to importers if the dumping margin goes down, not increased if it goes up. In addition, while the EC compares average prices in such cases, the US uses zeroing (i.e. it disregards the non-dumped transactions). Hence, zeroing in reviews in the US system (with its ability to increase the duty rate) can be said to give the US a &rsquo;structural advantage&rsquo; over the EC and other WTO Members.</p>",

However, EU companies have experienced problems when importing into Turkey.

This problem mainly affects products like pumps, electric linear actuator systems, designer objects for household use, thermos.</p>\n<p>In addition, increased TAREKS inspections on phthalates in footwear have been reported since 10 August 2014.

Normally, products in free circulation in the EU with a A.TR. certificate should have direct access to the Turkish market except where checks are justified on the basis of a risk analysis. However, EU companies have experienced problems when importing into Turkey. The common denominator is that Turkish authorities are demanding to see test reports for products, even though there haven't been any incidents of malfunctions or defects with the products. This problem mainly affects products like pumps, electric linear actuator systems, designer objects for household use, thermos.</p>\n<p>In addition, increased TAREKS inspections on phthalates in footwear have been reported since 10 August 2014. Results from accredited EU laboratories are not accepted. The failing rate for FTA&nbsp;partners is of 0,3%</p>",

        "description": "<p>1) Ad-valorem taxation on spirits was fully eliminated by a Turkish government decree adopted on 6 April 2009 and new specific duty rates, in line with the EU acquis, were introduced. However, these rates discriminated in favour of domestically produced raki and against types of spirits primarily imported from the EU (e.g. whisky and rum). Then, in the framework of the negotiations to open chapter 16 &ndash; Taxation, Turkey adopted an Action Plan on 18 May 2009, setting clear milestones with a view to the full gradual elimination of discriminatory taxation on spirituous beverages and imported tobacco. Since then, Turkey has introduced successive across the board excise tax increases, where the same percentage increase was applied to each category of spirits. This was not in accordance with the Turkish Action Plan. This barrier was qualified as \"key\" barrier during the update of the key barriers list in February 2014.</p>\n<p><br />2) Turkey previously required two certificates for importation from the EU &ndash; the Certificate of Conformity for Importation (CCI) required by the Tobacco Board and the Control Certificate (CC) required by the Ministry of Agriculture. However, the CCI requirement was abolished in 2008 and the brand-specific import permit - the Control Certificate - at the end of 2011. Currently we monitor the pre-notification regime which is now in place. This barrier is not a key barrier.</p>\n<p><br />3) In September 2013, Turkey introduced a new product verification and tracking label for food stuffs, including alcoholic beverages, without properly notifying this, either under the TRIS or under the WTO TBT Agreement. We were informed that Turkey has revised its legislation so that alcoholic beverages will no longer be included.</p>\n<p><br />4) We are informed that the Turkish customs authorities are carrying out excessive sampling controls whereby, generally, at least 2 bottles are removed for analysis, on each depletion of stock from bonded warehouses. Turkey has put in place an inspection regime and if companies apply for and submit to an authorisation check, the level of sampling can be reduced from 100% to 10%. Since the EU has stringent controls on safety standards for alcoholic beverages and we have a Customs Union with free movement of goods, such sampling controls in Turkey should not be necessary. This barrier was qualified as \"key\" barrier during the update of the key barriers list in February 2014.</p>\n<p><br />5). Legislation on warning messages placed on containers of alcoholic beverages and procedures and principles concerning domestic and foreign trading of alcoholic beverages.<br />In mid-2013, the Turkish government enacted legislation imposing a range of restrictions, including: (a) a ban on advertising and promotion of alcoholic beverages and to restrict on- and off-trade premises close to places of worship or education; and (b) to require all alcoholic beverages to carry health warnings.<br />The legislation requires all alcoholic beverages to show 3 logos, targeted at minors, pregnant women and drivers, with an additional message which translates as &lsquo;alcohol is not your friend&rsquo;.<br />In addition, EU brewers that normally use a uniform mark for their entire product range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, may not be able to sell their alcohol-free beer in Turkey, if the variant containing alcohol is already on the Turkish market and vice-versa.This barrier is not a key barrier.</p>\n<p><br />6). The appointment of a new operating company for the product-tracking system under the Ministry of Finance and the possible introduction of a new strip stamp system for alcoholic beverages in Turkey has been pending for more than a year. With regard to beer, the unit price for coded labels for imported bottled or canned beers, applied in foreign production facilities (including bonded warehouses and free zones) by the importers&rsquo; own capabilities is higher than the equivalent unit price for locally produced bottled or canned beers applied on serial production lines by the producers themselves in their own facilities. Turkey has indicated that the discrimination was removed.<br />&nbsp;This barrier was qualified as \"key\" barrier during the update of the key barriers list in February 2014.</p>",

However, the CCI requirement was abolished in 2008 and the brand-specific import permit - the Control Certificate - at the end of 2011. Currently we monitor the pre-notification regime which is now in place. This barrier is not a key barrier.</p>\n<p><br />3) In September 2013, Turkey introduced a new product verification and tracking label for food stuffs, including alcoholic beverages, without properly notifying this, either under the TRIS or under the WTO TBT Agreement. We were informed that Turkey has revised its legislation so that alcoholic beverages will no longer be included.</p>\n<p><br />4) We are informed that the Turkish customs authorities are carrying out excessive sampling controls whereby, generally, at least 2 bottles are removed for analysis, on each depletion of stock from bonded warehouses. Turkey has put in place an inspection regime and if companies apply for and submit to an authorisation check, the level of sampling can be reduced from 100% to 10%. Since the EU has stringent controls on safety standards for alcoholic beverages and we have a Customs Union with free movement of goods, such sampling controls in Turkey should not be necessary. This barrier was qualified as \"key\" barrier during the update of the key barriers list in February 2014.</p>\n<p><br />5). Legislation on warning messages placed on containers of alcoholic beverages and procedures and principles concerning domestic and foreign trading of alcoholic beverages.<br />In mid-2013, the Turkish government enacted legislation imposing a range of restrictions, including: (a) a ban on advertising and promotion of alcoholic beverages and to restrict on- and off-trade premises close to places of worship or education; and (b) to require all alcoholic beverages to carry health warnings.<br />The legislation requires all alcoholic beverages to show 3 logos, targeted at minors, pregnant women and drivers, with an additional message which translates as &lsquo;alcohol is not your friend&rsquo;.<br />In addition, EU brewers that normally use a uniform mark for their entire product range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, may not be able to sell their alcohol-free beer in Turkey, if the variant containing alcohol is already on the Turkish market and vice-versa.This barrier is not a key barrier.</p>\n<p><br />6). The appointment of a new operating company for the product-tracking system under the Ministry of Finance and the possible introduction of a new strip stamp system for alcoholic beverages in Turkey has been pending for more than a year. With regard to beer, the unit price for coded labels for imported bottled or canned beers, applied in foreign production facilities (including bonded warehouses and free zones) by the importers&rsquo; own capabilities is higher than the equivalent unit price for locally produced bottled or canned beers applied on serial production lines by the producers themselves in their own facilities. Turkey has indicated that the discrimination was removed.<br />&nbsp;This barrier was qualified as \"key\" barrier during the update of the key barriers list in February 2014.</p>",

There are concerns on misappropriation of many European GI names.</p>\n<p>GI protection for wines and spirits is in place since January 2004 (when Law No 25.163 of 1999 entered into force) and for agricultural and food products since May 2009 (when law No 25.380 of 2001 entered into force).</p>\n<p>Despite the registration procedures being open to foreign right holders, so far no EU GI has been registered. And without registration, EU GI holders lack legal means to defend their rights in Argentina.</p>\n<p>At the same time the existing Mercosur rules (MERCOSUR/GMC/Resoluci&oacute;n N&deg;26/03 - transposing TRIPS requirements) and implemented in Argentina by Resolution 146/2004 on labelling of packaged foods, establishes that the geographical appellations of a country, a region or a population, recognised as places, in which are manufactured foods with specific characteristics, cannot be used for labelling or advertisement of foods manufactured in other places when this can mislead the customer. It prohibits the use of the expression \"type\" to names associated with wines and spirits (TRIPS requirement) but allows it for agricultural products and foodstuffs. This latter increases the risk that those names become \"generic\".</p>\n<p>In addition, there is widespread misappropriation of European GI names notably in the wine and spirit sector (for instance private operators try to obtain registration of European GI names, logos or official mentions as trademarks). The settlement of such cases through INPI (Instituto Nacional de la Propiedad Intelectual) takes much time.</p>",

Among the documents required for the registration, the Decree includes a <span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">certificate that the producer&nbsp;and/or the trademark owner maintain \"</span><em><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">a quality control </span>system</em>.\" All the documents to be provided have to be certified by a Chamber of Commerce, approved by an Egyptian embassy and translated by an accredited translation centre.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>EBCA mentioned that their members (international brands) work with a network of trusted vendors, and that they would have to submit hundreds of requests.</p>\n<p><u>Certificates of Inspection: <em>Refer to Decree No. 43/2016</em></u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>certificates of inspections will be mandatory for custom release (tests and inspection to match Egyptian standards). Regarding specifically cosmetics, the safety of cosmetics products is already regulated by the Ministry of Health. Therefore cosmetics products should be exempted of this certification. This dual procedure will create huge administrative and economic burden without any gain for the consumer safety.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the framework of the Customs Union between EU and Turkey, duty-free tariff quotas for processed agricultural products have been established and set out in the EC-Turkey Association Council Decision 1/2007. The duty-free tariff quotas cover a list of processed agricultural products on both sides, among others, chocolates, bakery products, pasta and sugar confectionery. The&nbsp;Mininstry of Economy (MoE)&nbsp;is the competent authority in charge of the management of the tariff quota system in Turkey. For the allocation of quotas the principle used in the EU and set in the Turkish legislation is that of &rsquo;first come-first served&rsquo;. However, when implementing the quotas for certain products, the Turkish authorities continue to impose a series of specific requirements inter alia: a maximum of 10 tons per application per single customs code, a possibility of further application only after completion of the previous one, applicants should be producers based in Turkey etc. This management of tariff quota allocations by Turkey does not allow EU exporters to benefit from the duty free quotas in a transparent manner and without additional administrative burden.

The&nbsp;Mininstry of Economy (MoE)&nbsp;is the competent authority in charge of the management of the tariff quota system in Turkey. For the allocation of quotas the principle used in the EU and set in the Turkish legislation is that of &rsquo;first come-first served&rsquo;. However, when implementing the quotas for certain products, the Turkish authorities continue to impose a series of specific requirements inter alia: a maximum of 10 tons per application per single customs code, a possibility of further application only after completion of the previous one, applicants should be producers based in Turkey etc. This management of tariff quota allocations by Turkey does not allow EU exporters to benefit from the duty free quotas in a transparent manner and without additional administrative burden.

The only modifications were limited to replacing corporate social security charge by a lower charge applied to corporate revenues. Furthermore it was announced that the value added tax applied to imported goods at the interstate level will be harmonized nationally and reduced down to 4% from the current 7-12% range depending on the State of destination. Nevertheless, as the Government itself assumes, more comprehensive reforms are still needed in order to streamline Brazil&acute;s complex tax system. Although the reform is claimed to be a priority of the new administration after the election of 2014, no specific projects were made public so far. The only modifications aimed at an \"adjustment\" between taxable basis of certain contributions for domestic and nationally produced goods (PIS/COFINS) that consisted of an introduction of differential tax rates which added to the complexity and ambiguity of the system. Additional main concerns for EU operators pertain, in particular, the lack of alignment with OECD practices when calculating the transfer pricing, the CIDE tax, levied on the transfer of any kind of \"technology\", the high tax rates applied to imported perfumes, the increase of PIS/COFINS levied on imports and the Reintegra programme for tax reimbursements of exports.</p>\n<p><em>The main concerns of EU companies are:</em></p>\n<p>&bull; <strong>Lack of alignment with OECD practises</strong> <strong>regarding of transfer pricing, business profit and intra-group tax rules</strong> - The Brazilian Act 9959 of 27 January 2000 establishes a specific \"PRL-method\" (Metodo do Pre&ccedil;o de revenda menos Lucro) whereby transfer pricing is defined as the average resale price of the final product minus several kind of taxes, commissions and discounts on sales and a potential profit margin of 60%. This calculation method may differ from the result of the arm&rsquo;s length principle, which is advocated by the OECD rules where transfer pricing of intra-group transactions must be the same as if the parties were not related. The method applied may lead to a tax distortion, when calculating tax revenues of the host countries, and lead to double taxation issues.</p>\n<p>&bull; <strong>Problems related to taxation of \"technological knowledge\" transfer due to the discriminatory nature of the CIDE tax </strong>(tax on the contribution for intervention in the economic domain), which was established by Law 10168/2000 and further complemented by Law 10332/2001. CIDE is collected to provide financial support to priority scientific and technological development programs and projects. CIDE is levied on payments made by Brazilian companies to foreign suppliers which provide inter alia some kind of \"technological knowledge\" such as patent assignments, trademarks or technical assistance services. Since 2006, CIDE no longer applies to software, except when it involves transfer of the corresponding technology (Articles 20 and 21 of Law 11452/2007). CIDE amounts to 10% of the underlying transaction. However, the retroactive effect of the law with regard to software only goes back to 1 January 2006. By contrast, Brazilian companies are not subject to CIDE when they pay for the acquisition or use of domestically produced \"technology\".</p>\n<p>&bull; <strong>Taxation of perfumes versus \"eau de toilette\"</strong> &ndash; Due to the lack of fiscal or custom legislation that precisely defines perfume and \"eau de toilette\", Brazilian fiscal administration uses Decree 79094/77, which was complemented by a sanitary regulation, making&nbsp;the distinction between these two products on the basis of their respective concentration of aromas. As a result of this distinction, Brazilian importers (ADIPEC - Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o dos Distribuidores e Importadores de Perfumes e Cosm&eacute;ticos) confirmed that most Brazilian domestic products are classified as &rsquo;eau de toilette&rsquo; and taxed at an IPI (Tax on Industrial Products) rate of 12%, while most of imports from the EU are considered to be perfumes and taxed at 42%. The issue was also dealt with at EU-Brazil Joint Committee meetings. No progress was reported, and despite Brazil&acute;s confirmation on on-going revision of the Decree 79094/77, no modifications took place so far. However, according to the Ministry of Finance the sanitary regulation in question seems not to be a valid legal basis for making this distinction.</p>\n<p><strong>&bull; Introduction of an increased rate of PIS/COFINS <em>for imports </em>- </strong>PIS and COFINS increases for imported goods were officially introduced by the Provisional Measure (MP) 668/15 adopted and published on 30 January 2015. The combined PIS/COFINS rate for imports was increased generally by 2.5 percent (from 9.25 percent to 11.75 percent) with a higher increase for certain specific categories of products (pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, tyres etc.). The increased contributions applied as of 1 May 2015 (90 days after the publication as per the constitutional requirement). The MP 690/2015 was adopted by the Congress and published as Law 13.137/2015 of 19 June 2015. In addition to a higher tax rate for specific products, the measure also introduces restrictions in the use of tax credits that operate only for imports of these specific products and as a result importers can only deduct from their PIS/COFINS liabilities the amount of the standard rate. This results in an increase of the effective tax paid by importers, who cannot offset against future liabilities the full amount of the tax paid, contrary to local producers.Furthermore some imported products are subjected to a supplementary 1% PIS/COFINS tax, also without the possibility of earning a tax credit.<br />The tax hikes and credit restrictions affect only imported goods, which thereby are placed at a competitive disadvantage in the Brazilian market. According to the Brazilian Government, the rationale for the tax increase relates to a need to compensate for the difference between the taxable bases for imported products (that following the Supreme Federal Tribunal &ndash;STF &ndash; Ruling 55937/2013 must be the customs value, without adding any other taxes or charges) and for domestic companies (where other domestically paid fiscal burdens are apparently included i.e. ICMS).</p>\n<p><strong>&bull; Reintegra - </strong>Law <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">No. 12,546 of 14 December 2011 introduced the Special Regime for the <span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\">Reimbursement of Taxes for Exporters, known as </span></span><em><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\">Reintegra</span></span></em><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\">.

There were 7 categories of products concerned: food supplements, honey, energy drinks, black tea, vegetable oil, baby nutrition and alcoholic beverages. After a Turkish Court decision the alcoholic beverage category was unofficially exempted from the new system's scope. According to this measure new label, designed to provide consumers with the ability to verify that the product is a genuin one, has to be added (the measure was officially presented as a verification and monitoring system to fight against counterfeited products). According to the information received from DG AGRI, the labels will be made by a company which is in a situation of monopoly. The COM has sent comments via the TBT channel (TBT-G/TBT/N/TUR/45) on 24 July 2014. In October a reminder was sent to the TR authorities which provided a written comments and replies on 4 November 2014. Turkey has postponed once again the application of the measure unil 1st March 2015.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The registration in Mexico of foreign geographical indications (GI) as such is not possible and alternatives offer only weak and uncertain protection. This opens the way to a number of imitations and usurpations of European names and GI&rsquo;s, which affect the access to the market of the authentic products and raise confusion among consumers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The EU has a wide variety of protected GIs. They constitute an important pillar of the EU&rsquo;s quality policy on agricultural products and constitute a genuine interest for producers as they unlock value by capitalising on consumer&rsquo;s desire for diversity and quality products.</p>\n<p>The registration of foreign GIs in Mexico remains difficult despite Mexico&rsquo;s obligations under the TRIPS Agreement. The national GI legislation is unclear as regards GI protection and inappropriate for foreign GIs. Another widespread practice which affects EU GIs in Mexico is the misuse of expressions such as \"tipo &hellip;\" or \"estilo &hellip;\" on labels. These branding practices generate unfair competition, consumer confusion and contribute to undermining the reputation and image of the genuine products.</p>\n<p>The registration of a foreign GI as such is technically impossible in Mexico, since the legislation states that the Federal State is the owner of any Denomination of Origin (DO). The only ways for a European GI to obtain some protection within the Mexican territory are either registration as a collective trademark at the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (IMPI), or being covered by the Lisbon Agreement (of which Mexico is a party) or by the EU-Mexico bilateral Spirits Agreement signed in 1997. The EU &ndash; Mexico Free Trade Agreement (FTA) does not offer any protection to GI other than spirits.</p>\n<p>Some EU right holders have tried without success for a long time to protect their rights via the trademark system, which handles applications in a sometimes non consistent way (e.g. Parma Ham). Registration of a GI as a collective trademark provides a weak protection since the compliance to the Mexican quality standard is voluntary (while it is compulsory for Mexican DO), and also because any disputes would have to be solved in court, which involves lengthy, costly and uncertain procedures.</p>\n<p>Besides the registration related difficulties encountered by right holders for their GIs registered in the EU and/or under the Lisbon agreement, there is wide consumer confusion on the use of names or distinctive signs of EU countries and regions for all sorts of products.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Main cases</strong></em></p>\n<p>Jerez<br />Some Mexican wines bear the indication Jerez or \"tipo Jerez\" on their labels. Since the bilateral EU &ndash; Mexico spirits agreement does not apply to wines, and Spain is not a member of the Lisbon Agreement, the Jerez Consortium can only refer to TRIPS (not explicitly translated into Mexican law) to seek protection against the usurpation of the name.</p>\n<p>Manchego<br />Mexico has a long history of production and consumption of so called \"manchego\" cheese (a product elaborated from cow milk, as opposed to sheep milk as for the original Spanish product) and for this reason the term manchego became a generic in Mexico in 1984 (as defined in the Mexican industrial standard NMX-F-462-1984). Mexico held a consultation process related to the cancellation of this Manchego norm. Thus it is currently not possible to challenge the use of this name by Mexican producers and distributors. This confusing situation has opened the way to importation in Mexico of imitations of Manchego, with similar characteristics to the Spanish cheese, produced in third countries.</p>\n<p>Prosciutto di Parma<br />Ham consumption in Mexico exceeds 120.000 tons per year, which places it as a key export market for EU producers of cured ham. The Consorzio del Prosciutto di Parma has endeavoured for years to protect its rights, be it through the trademark system or as a GI via the Lisbon Agreement. It has launched several legal actions but remains to date without any legal instrument against the widespread use of trademarks encompassing the term \"Parma\". IMPI rejected the application by the Consorzio for the trademark \"Prosciutto di Parma\" on the ground that it was generic, but did register the trademark \"Parma\" in favour of a company unrelated to the Consorzio. This trademark has been used for commercialising hams unrelated to the EU and the Lisbon-protected GI. In 2002, IMPI refused to protect the GI \"Prosciutto di Parma\" notified under the Lisbon Agreement on appellations of origin, arguing on the existence of a prior trademark. A Mexican company is selling Mexican cured ham with the trademark \"Parma\". As a result, Italian exporters are hindered in accessing the Mexican market and the reputation of their genuine product is harmed.&nbsp;</p>",

            "description": "<p>The registration in Mexico of foreign geographical indications (GI) as such is not possible and alternatives offer only weak and uncertain protection. This opens the way to a number of imitations and usurpations of European names and GI&rsquo;s, which affect the access to the market of the authentic products and raise confusion among consumers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The EU has a wide variety of protected GIs. They constitute an important pillar of the EU&rsquo;s quality policy on agricultural products and constitute a genuine interest for producers as they unlock value by capitalising on consumer&rsquo;s desire for diversity and quality products.</p>\n<p>The registration of foreign GIs in Mexico remains difficult despite Mexico&rsquo;s obligations under the TRIPS Agreement. The national GI legislation is unclear as regards GI protection and inappropriate for foreign GIs. Another widespread practice which affects EU GIs in Mexico is the misuse of expressions such as \"tipo &hellip;\" or \"estilo &hellip;\" on labels. These branding practices generate unfair competition, consumer confusion and contribute to undermining the reputation and image of the genuine products.</p>\n<p>The registration of a foreign GI as such is technically impossible in Mexico, since the legislation states that the Federal State is the owner of any Denomination of Origin (DO). The only ways for a European GI to obtain some protection within the Mexican territory are either registration as a collective trademark at the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (IMPI), or being covered by the Lisbon Agreement (of which Mexico is a party) or by the EU-Mexico bilateral Spirits Agreement signed in 1997. The EU &ndash; Mexico Free Trade Agreement (FTA) does not offer any protection to GI other than spirits.</p>\n<p>Some EU right holders have tried without success for a long time to protect their rights via the trademark system, which handles applications in a sometimes non consistent way (e.g. Parma Ham). Registration of a GI as a collective trademark provides a weak protection since the compliance to the Mexican quality standard is voluntary (while it is compulsory for Mexican DO), and also because any disputes would have to be solved in court, which involves lengthy, costly and uncertain procedures.</p>\n<p>Besides the registration related difficulties encountered by right holders for their GIs registered in the EU and/or under the Lisbon agreement, there is wide consumer confusion on the use of names or distinctive signs of EU countries and regions for all sorts of products.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Main cases</strong></em></p>\n<p>Jerez<br />Some Mexican wines bear the indication Jerez or \"tipo Jerez\" on their labels. Since the bilateral EU &ndash; Mexico spirits agreement does not apply to wines, and Spain is not a member of the Lisbon Agreement, the Jerez Consortium can only refer to TRIPS (not explicitly translated into Mexican law) to seek protection against the usurpation of the name.</p>\n<p>Manchego<br />Mexico has a long history of production and consumption of so called \"manchego\" cheese (a product elaborated from cow milk, as opposed to sheep milk as for the original Spanish product) and for this reason the term manchego became a generic in Mexico in 1984 (as defined in the Mexican industrial standard NMX-F-462-1984). Mexico held a consultation process related to the cancellation of this Manchego norm. Thus it is currently not possible to challenge the use of this name by Mexican producers and distributors. This confusing situation has opened the way to importation in Mexico of imitations of Manchego, with similar characteristics to the Spanish cheese, produced in third countries.</p>\n<p>Prosciutto di Parma<br />Ham consumption in Mexico exceeds 120.000 tons per year, which places it as a key export market for EU producers of cured ham. The Consorzio del Prosciutto di Parma has endeavoured for years to protect its rights, be it through the trademark system or as a GI via the Lisbon Agreement. It has launched several legal actions but remains to date without any legal instrument against the widespread use of trademarks encompassing the term \"Parma\". IMPI rejected the application by the Consorzio for the trademark \"Prosciutto di Parma\" on the ground that it was generic, but did register the trademark \"Parma\" in favour of a company unrelated to the Consorzio. This trademark has been used for commercialising hams unrelated to the EU and the Lisbon-protected GI. In 2002, IMPI refused to protect the GI \"Prosciutto di Parma\" notified under the Lisbon Agreement on appellations of origin, arguing on the existence of a prior trademark. A Mexican company is selling Mexican cured ham with the trademark \"Parma\".

Therefore very few approvals are being awarded and delays the process of market access, which needs on average about 4 years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>COFEPRIS was established in 2001 by breaking out various directorates of the Ministry of Health to enhance the risk management in the public health sector. In the 2008 public health sector reform the responsibility for the registration of about 10,000 pharmaceuticals and 40,000 medical devices was attributed to COFEPRIS. But COFEPRIS suffered from a lack of updated referentials to technical regulations and of well trained staff, offices, computers etc. This resulted in a backlog of registrations of medical and agro-chemical products. Since 2011 the situation has improved, although there are some on-going difficulties with the registration process of new molecules. The Commissioner, who is in office since March 2011, made effective administrative changes to reduce the administrative burdens (third party pre-validation, narrowing down the number of medical devices that need approval, i.e. exempting low risk ones), facilitated registrations and increased transparency of the institution. But the industry views that these initiatives are not enough to address appropriately the underlying problem of lack of resources and qualified staff of COFEPRIS.</p>\n<p>The approval process is composed on 3 stages:<br />1<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">st</span></sup> stage: COFEPRIS (Comisi&oacute;n Federal para la Protecci&oacute;n contra Riesgos Sanitarios),<br />2<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">nd</span></sup> stage: CSG (Consejo de salubridad General) of the Ministry of Health and<br />3<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">rd</span></sup> stage: ISSSTE (Instituto de seguridad y servicios sociales de los trabajadores del estado) covering public workers - IMSS (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social) covering workers in the private sector and funded by both public and private sources - SP (Seguro Popular) covering unaffiliated persons and is publicly financed.</p>\n<p>The 3<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">rd</span></sup> stage seems to be the most problematic one. The first two stages approve the molecules for scientific use but the molecules are not approved for purchasing and using them for patients in the medical sector. Although COFEPRIS has a rejection rate of around 5% since 2010, IMSS has only released 4% of the molecules approved by COFEPRIS, down from 24% in 2011.</p>\n<p><em>Equivalency agreements</em><br />On 5 October 2012, Mexico unilaterally granted recognition of sanitary registrations emitted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for new medicines. Equivalency was also granted to a number of other countries.</p>\n<p>Registration of agro-chemical products<br />The main problems for EU companies to register agro-chemicals are excessive delays, the confidentiality of provided information and unclear procedures. However, the situation in this context seems having improved in recent years.&nbsp;</p>",

            "description": "<p>The process for marketing authorisations for pharmaceutical and agro-chemical products includes three stages and several actors. Therefore very few approvals are being awarded and delays the process of market access, which needs on average about 4 years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>COFEPRIS was established in 2001 by breaking out various directorates of the Ministry of Health to enhance the risk management in the public health sector. In the 2008 public health sector reform the responsibility for the registration of about 10,000 pharmaceuticals and 40,000 medical devices was attributed to COFEPRIS. But COFEPRIS suffered from a lack of updated referentials to technical regulations and of well trained staff, offices, computers etc. This resulted in a backlog of registrations of medical and agro-chemical products. Since 2011 the situation has improved, although there are some on-going difficulties with the registration process of new molecules. The Commissioner, who is in office since March 2011, made effective administrative changes to reduce the administrative burdens (third party pre-validation, narrowing down the number of medical devices that need approval, i.e. exempting low risk ones), facilitated registrations and increased transparency of the institution. But the industry views that these initiatives are not enough to address appropriately the underlying problem of lack of resources and qualified staff of COFEPRIS.</p>\n<p>The approval process is composed on 3 stages:<br />1<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">st</span></sup> stage: COFEPRIS (Comisi&oacute;n Federal para la Protecci&oacute;n contra Riesgos Sanitarios),<br />2<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">nd</span></sup> stage: CSG (Consejo de salubridad General) of the Ministry of Health and<br />3<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">rd</span></sup> stage: ISSSTE (Instituto de seguridad y servicios sociales de los trabajadores del estado) covering public workers - IMSS (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social) covering workers in the private sector and funded by both public and private sources - SP (Seguro Popular) covering unaffiliated persons and is publicly financed.</p>\n<p>The 3<sup><span style=\"font-size: small;\">rd</span></sup> stage seems to be the most problematic one. The first two stages approve the molecules for scientific use but the molecules are not approved for purchasing and using them for patients in the medical sector. Although COFEPRIS has a rejection rate of around 5% since 2010, IMSS has only released 4% of the molecules approved by COFEPRIS, down from 24% in 2011.</p>\n<p><em>Equivalency agreements</em><br />On 5 October 2012, Mexico unilaterally granted recognition of sanitary registrations emitted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for new medicines. Equivalency was also granted to a number of other countries.</p>\n<p>Registration of agro-chemical products<br />The main problems for EU companies to register agro-chemicals are excessive delays, the confidentiality of provided information and unclear procedures. However, the situation in this context seems having improved in recent years.&nbsp;</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mexico has traditionally imposed significant restrictions on foreign direct investment in a number of important economic sectors, which have been reserved to the State or to Mexican citizens, or where foreign participation is limited to certain ceilings. This has been a major barrier for access of EU (and other) companies to the Mexican markets, particularly in key services sectors, and also has an impact on the overall competitiveness of the Mexican economy. Furthermore, cumbersome procedures and weak rule of law impose additional costs on foreign investors in all sectors. However, since 2013 Mexico has undertaken the \"Pact for Mexico\" structural reforms in several key economic sectors such as the telecommunication, energy, labour, insurance and leasing sectors. These reforms aim, among other things, at opening the sectors for foreign investment. The content of their respective secondary legislation and its implementation will be key for the industry to determine the impact of the reforms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>Restrictions on foreign capital participation in Mexico have been eased through successive reforms. Sectors previously open only to NAFTA countries have subsequently been open to all foreign investors and foreign capital participation is allowed up to 100% in many industrial sectors.</p>\n<p>The May 2013 telecommunication reform lifted the 49% limitation of foreign investors in fixed telephony and improved competition in the Mexican phone and television market. Foreign investors can have up to 49% ownership of radio broadcasters pending on a decision of the foreign investment commission. Existing television networks have to offer their free-to-air programming for no cost to cable operators and the latter have to carry all channels. Consequently, now foreign investors can offer triple play (internet, television and telephone over a single broadband connection) at national level.</p>\n<p>The energy reform eliminated restrictions on private and foreign participation in the areas of production, imports and exports, refining, transport and storage of all types of oil products and derivatives. Starting from 2016, the commercialisation and importing of petrol will be liberalised. As from 2018 private actors can run petrol stations and from this year the government will no longer control the price to consumers. As for the electricity sector, the transmission of electricity will remain in the hands of the state (CFE) but CFE can sign contracts with private companies for construction and other services relating to the network. The reform also allows for the creation of a wholesale market between private actors for contracts above 3 MW and electricity transmission can take place between private contractors through a permit. The CFE will continue to operate the system for distribution of electricity.</p>\n<p>However, some restrictions remain in important economic sectors. These vary from outright prohibitions to ceilings on equity participation. As regards total prohibitions, these include the following sectors:<br />&bull; Telegraphic and radio telegraphic services, radioactive materials, coinage and printing of money, postal service, control, supervision and surveillance of ports of entry are sectors reserved for the State in whole or in part.<br />&bull; Non-cable radio and television services, development banks (law was modified in 2008), certain professional and technical services, and domestic transportation for passengers, tourism and freight, except for messenger or package delivery, remain completely reserved to Mexican nationals (art. 6 of the Foreign Investment Law).</p>\n<p>As for ceilings on equity participation, the following sectors remain affected: <br />&bull; Transport (land transportation): The Mexican government allows up to 49 % foreign ownership of 50-year concessions to operate parts of the railroad system, renewable for a second 50-year period. The Mexican Foreign Investment Commission and COFECO must approve ownership above 49 %. Also foreign express delivery service companies continue to complain that the Mexican legislation unfairly favours Mexican companies by restricting the size of trucks international carriers are allowed to use.<br />&bull; Air passenger transport: Foreign ownership of Mexican airlines remains capped at 25 % and foreign ownership of airports is limited to 49 %. <br />&bull; Real estate: Investment restrictions still prohibit foreigners from acquiring title to residential real estate in so-called \"restricted zones\" within 50 kilometres of the nation&rsquo;s coast and 100 kilometres of the borders. In all, the restricted zones total about 40 % of Mexico&rsquo;s territory. Nevertheless, foreigners may acquire the effective use of residential property in the restricted zones through the establishment of a 50-year extendable trust (called a fideicomiso) arranged through a Mexican financial institution that acts as trustee. <br />&bull; Certain port services, some financial services and air transportation still have limitations on foreign ownership. In addition, for some of the sectors in which a 100 % foreign ownership is allowed, prior permission granted by the Investment Commission is required (Article 8 of the Foreign Investment Law).<br /><br />An additional cost for foreign investors include the complex administrative procedures caused by the lack of coordination between the local, state and federal authorities, and by the complexity, inefficiency and uncertainty of legal proceedings. The general weakness of rule of law is caused by lack of resources, lack of transparency, abuse of \"amparo\" procedures (judicial review for the protection of constitutional rights) and vulnerability to criminal intimidation. It is possible that interest groups will make use of the \"amparo\" possibilities to challenge some aspects of the reforms.&nbsp;</p>",

The Fair Price Law also establishes restrictions to make intertemporal adjustments to the authorized cost structures caused by any discretionary adjustment in the levels of local wages decreed by the Government as well as to increase prices due to the rise in prices of inputs, intermediate goods, energy tariffs, services and other indirect costs, as a result of the high domestic inflation.</p>",

Local law establishes controls to free pricing of products in the domestic market, including the direct supervision of importers profits by the National Superintendence for the Defence of Social and Economic Rights (SUNDDE).</p>\n<p>The OLFP operates in order to mitigate speculative and inflationary effects of multifactorial origin and it is not intended to protect local production from lower prices imports. Market access is limited by the price structure determined by the SUNDDE for each product, including the establishment of maximum profit margins, which affects companies and agents importers and dealers. The Fair Price Law also establishes restrictions to make intertemporal adjustments to the authorized cost structures caused by any discretionary adjustment in the levels of local wages decreed by the Government as well as to increase prices due to the rise in prices of inputs, intermediate goods, energy tariffs, services and other indirect costs, as a result of the high domestic inflation.</p>",

Recent Regulation 139/2014 seems a step towards progressive alignment with international standards of the OIE on BSE. In this respect, the Regulation opens for import from negligible status countries and seems to possibly open a door from imports from controlled status countries, though the wording is still not very clear. In any case, imports are very limited. Article 5 of the same regulation seems to favour local beef, though Indonesia rejects this view. Indonesian legislation requires both country and establishment approval (through both a declaration (questionnaire) and on-site assessment) for import of meat and meat products. This process is burdensome and non-transparent. The criteria for passing the approval process are unclear, thus resulting in a long approval procedure. Related to others diseases, Indonesia require absence of a number of diseases in a country or establishment for which OIE does not consider trade measures necessary. Indonesia introduced the principle of regionalisation in its legislation from 2009 only for foot and mouth disease (FMD) and not for other diseases for which OIE also foresees this principle.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Law 18/2009 introduced burdensome and non-transparent risk assessment procedures for meat and dairy imports stemming from country establishment approval requirements. Moreover, the law provided that all imported derived animal products have to be certified &rsquo;halal&rsquo;. Law 18/2009 introduced a country and establishment approval entailing that every single exporting establishment need to be inspected. The procedure requires that foreign companies exporting fresh animal products (meat, dairy products, eggs etc.) have to register which are then to submit to plant-by-plant inspections. The Regulation 139/2014 still request country and establishment audit and approval.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Halal matters are also a significant complication.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Trading conditions (not SPS) set in regulation 139 2014 and later in 58/2015 make even more complicated market access: restrictions on certain cuts and products, use of reference prices, an unclear and complex import license system....</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">New policies are planned without consulting trading partners, potentially completely banning or severely obstructing imports.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Since the introduction of the ban in 2001 the EU together with trading partners have consistently raised the issue in all available fora, and in bilateral meetings.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Update: the regulation 58/2015 apparently might allow imports of countries with controlled risk status, though the wording make this unclear. The EU is still trying to get clarification on this. As mentioned, a number of non-strictly SPS barriers are still present in this regulation. The EU has raised concerns.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Update: the regulation 34/2016 continues the same pattern, with apparently allowed imports from countries with controlled risk status but unclear procedures and requirements. The COM made comments in writing but no feedback has been received.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The FTA negotiations will probably&nbsp;offer a better scenario for constructive dialogue</span></p>",

Indonesia introduced the principle of regionalisation in its legislation from 2009 only for foot and mouth disease (FMD) and not for other diseases for which OIE also foresees this principle.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Law 18/2009 introduced burdensome and non-transparent risk assessment procedures for meat and dairy imports stemming from country establishment approval requirements. Moreover, the law provided that all imported derived animal products have to be certified &rsquo;halal&rsquo;. Law 18/2009 introduced a country and establishment approval entailing that every single exporting establishment need to be inspected. The procedure requires that foreign companies exporting fresh animal products (meat, dairy products, eggs etc.) have to register which are then to submit to plant-by-plant inspections. The Regulation 139/2014 still request country and establishment audit and approval.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Halal matters are also a significant complication.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Trading conditions (not SPS) set in regulation 139 2014 and later in 58/2015 make even more complicated market access: restrictions on certain cuts and products, use of reference prices, an unclear and complex import license system....</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">New policies are planned without consulting trading partners, potentially completely banning or severely obstructing imports.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Since the introduction of the ban in 2001 the EU together with trading partners have consistently raised the issue in all available fora, and in bilateral meetings.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Update: the regulation 58/2015 apparently might allow imports of countries with controlled risk status, though the wording make this unclear. The EU is still trying to get clarification on this. As mentioned, a number of non-strictly SPS barriers are still present in this regulation. The EU has raised concerns.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Update: the regulation 34/2016 continues the same pattern, with apparently allowed imports from countries with controlled risk status but unclear procedures and requirements. The COM made comments in writing but no feedback has been received.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The FTA negotiations will probably&nbsp;offer a better scenario for constructive dialogue</span></p>",

Therefore the measure is unjustified, discriminatory and should be lifted without delay. In 2015, as a positive step, Vietnam allowed exports from France and eliminated the associated BSE restriction.</span></p>",

However, the obligations of the GPA apply only to the specific entities and sectors covered.</li>\n<li>The US GPA commitments are limited by way of various derogations. Also, only 37 States are committed to the GPA and with a limited scope. The broadest exemptions to the scope of the GPA concern the Buy American restrictions linked to Federal funding of procurement in specific areas as well as the broad set-asides for US small and medium sized enterprises.</li>\n<li>Currently regional or local US authorities and most other sub-central entities within US States have no legal obligation to treat bids from European companies on an equal footing with US companies.</li>\n<li>In fact many barriers have been erected against foreign bidders in the US procurement market and European companies currently face many obstacles that either prevent or significantly reduce their chances of winning government contracts in the US.</li>\n<li>The most important obstacles that European companies typically encounter both with respect to the US Federal Government as well as in US States are for example:\n<ul>\n<li>Various types of<strong> \"Buy American\" restrictions</strong>; When European companies bid for government contracts, their bids may be subject to discriminatory treatment or even find it excluded from consideration because the US law allows government offices to require use of American and local goods, services, suppliers and service providers or at least give them special favourable consideration.</li>\n<li><strong>US SME preference policy, </strong>which reserves about 23% of the value of US government contracts to US SMEs.</li>\n<li><strong>Large share of procuring entities within US States are not covered by any commitments </strong>and they are therefore not obliged to treat EU bidders on the same footing as US companies for procurement.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of transparency: </strong>It is not easy to find proper and timely information on government contracts opportunities in the US. There is no general access point (apart from the Federal tenders) to information on opportunities to bid for government contracts and the information is provided is often unclear.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>US Federal Government level</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The US Federal Government applies a Buy American policy on Federal procurement (contracts which the Federal agencies conclude) and also on procurement which the Federal Government funds within the States (contracts concluded with Federal money).</li>\n<li>Some US Federal agencies (such as the Federal Aviation Administration), are still obliged to discriminate against EU businesses on the basis of the 1933 \"<em>Buy American Act</em>\".</li>\n<li>In addition, restrictions based on the so called \"<em>Berry Amendment</em>\" establish that only US-products (including procurement of \"non-war\" material such as textiles) can be procured by the US Department of Defense.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, Federal agencies apply a mandatory <em>set-aside for US SMEs</em> for 23 % of the value of Federal procurement. EU companies cannot bid for those contracts unless they fulfil the requirements such as to be established and pay taxes in the US and employ US labour.</li>\n<li>US also exclude EU suppliers in procurement of for instance \"dredging services\" under the GPA. EU companies do therefore not have access to these contracts at US ports. The background for this restriction is with the \"Jones Act\", which prohibits foreign made dredgers to work there.</li>\n<li>\"<em>Buy America</em>\" restrictions:\n<ul>\n<li>One of the most fundamental obstacles for access to US procurement is a result of the <strong>\"Buy America Act\", </strong>which is a provision of the <em>Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 </em>and applies to <strong>mass-transit related procurement</strong><em>. </em>Restrictions concern procurement funded by the US Federal Government's Department of Transportation (Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration, Federal Railroad Administration and Federal Aviation Administration).</li>\n<li>The actual procurement contracts are concluded by States or entities within States, such as cities. On the basis of Buy America-restrictions, the Federal Government imposes US content requirements on procurement (that can go up to 100 %). These domestic content restrictions have been carved out from the scope of GPA commitments. The restrictions are effectively enforced as the sub-central recipient is bound to respect the funding conditions containing a Buy America obligation.</li>\n<li>Consequently, if a European bidder wants to tender for procurement contracts using Federal funds for example in a project to build new railway infrastructure, it must prove that it uses steel, iron and manufactured products produced in the US instead of using steel or products manufactured in Europe.</li>\n<li>Buy America type of provisions have become a regular feature of bills funding Federal grants to the states, municipal or transit authorities. Restrictions have also extended to areas outside of transportation, such as environmental infrastructure projects. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act (<em>WRRDA</em>) adopted in 2014, which imposed new and permanent Buy America restrictions on procurements funded by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Water infrastructure fund.</li>\n<li>The US Federal Government continues to introduce new laws or budget appropriations which either extend the scope of existing Buy America restrictions or impose new ones. One of the most recent legislative amendments by the US Federal Government adding stricter Buy America rules is the &ldquo;<em>Fixing America&rsquo;s Surface Transportation Act</em>&rdquo; (FAST Act). The FAST Act, which President Obama signed on December 4, 2015, reauthorizes surface transportation programs through fiscal year 2020. In doing so, it increases the domestic content requirements for rolling stock (such as buses) from the current 60% of the cost of all components to 65% for fiscal years 2018-19 and to 70%, beginning in FY 2020. The DOT&rsquo;s Federal Transit Administration, which provides funding to local public transit systems, including buses, subways, light rail, commuter rail, trolleys and ferries, will implement the new requirements. The FAST Act also tightens the waiver process applied by the Federal Transit Administration.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>It should also be noted that in order to be able to bid for contracts by Federal agencies, it is necessary to register with the System for Award Management (SAM). &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><u>US State level procurement</u></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The commitments made by the US at State level under the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) are limited in scope. Furthermore, the States' legal framework in procurement is very fragmented, which causes de factor barriers. Each of the US States has their own laws and they apply various levels of their own &ldquo;Buy American&rdquo; requirements giving favourable treatment to products which have been manufactured in the US. In particular, 27 States impose obligations within state-law to give favourable treatment to \"American made products\". Furthermore, some States impose obligations to favour US manufactured products when local entities use State-funds. These impose obligations to supply US manufactured products.</li>\n<li>In addition, many States also impose preferences which give favourable treatment to products manufactured within a specific State. On top of State-law based preferences, additional requirements are applied for example by many US cities. Finally, many US States apply specific set-asides for US SMEs established within their respective State.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>With regard to US States, only specific entities of 37 States out of the 50 US States have to follow the GPA rules, such as non-discrimination with respect to EU businesses. These are typically entities of State Government while for example cities are not covered by the GPA obligations. A majority of procuring entities within US States are not obliged to treat EU bidders on the same footing as US companies. A majority of procuring entities within US States are not obliged to treat EU bidders on the same footing as US companies. An example of an explicit exclusion from the scope of commitments is the procurement of vehicles by the States of Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New York, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Wyoming.</li>\n<li>Also States have a trend of imposing new and additional Buy America-restrictions. Recently both New Jersey and New York proposed to introduce new Buy America-laws. These legislative bills were, however, withdrawn at last stage.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The lack of easy access to information on procurement opportunities in the US States is a key deterrent to participate in US procurement. EU businesses can bid for contracts only if they are able to find information on them. EU companies need to navigate through hundreds of different procurement portals and suffer from various obstacles to register as bidders. In many States, in order receive information on contracts and in order to bid, companies first have to register with the State. For this each State applies its own requirements. Some States require a payment to register as a bidder. Registration requirements act as further market access obstacles.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>",

For maritime commercial entities to be able to benefit from the exclusive opportunities offered to them by the Jones Act and relating cabotage legislation (e.g. operation of US coastal trading and relating services), the vessels that they operate must be: US built, US owned, US maintained, and US crewed; furthermore, maritime commercial entities must be US controlled. It should be noted that cabotage legislation which restricts maritime transportation between ports of the same country is common everywhere in the world (and to a certain extent also in the EU). What makes the US legislation peculiar and unduly restrictive is the fact that domestic transportation &ndash; even when carried out by US operators - can only be performed by using vessels which are US built, US owned/controlled, US crewed and US maintained. These requirements, add to the effects of traditional cabotage measures important limitations in terms of shipbuilding (because no foreign built ship can be used), establishment (because only companies owned and controlled by Americans can carry out coastal trade services) and repair services (because vessels repaired/reconverted outside the US risk losing the necessary qualifications to operate again within US waters).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> The Jones Act is detailed as Chapter 24 (Merchant Marine Act, 1920) of the Appendix to Title 46 (Shipping) of the United States Code.

These include, for example, a price preference margin for all local suppliers of Thai goods in the range of 3% to 7% and the requirement of having a Thai leading firm for services contracts and if that is not possible, 50% Thai personnel to be engaged on the project.

            "description": "<p>The 1992 Prime Minister's Office Regulation on Procurement (as amended) provides a clear preference for \"domestic\" goods and services by using a range of initiatives that could limit the effective participation of EU businesses in the Thai government procurement market, while rules governing significant infrastructure projects, potentially eligible to international tenders, such as in the airport sector, do not follow international practices and suffer from lack of transparency. These include, for example, a price preference margin for all local suppliers of Thai goods in the range of 3% to 7% and the requirement of having a Thai leading firm for services contracts and if that is not possible, 50% Thai personnel to be engaged on the project. European business community in Thailand have also expressed concerns regarding the Thai Cabinet resolution of 20 January 2004 which removes arbitration clause from concession contracts; the authorities indicate that all dispute settlements should be made through the administrative or judicial courts governed by Thai laws. In this respect, the EU welcomes expressions of interest from Thailand in joining WTO Plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA).</p>",

In the past few years, Thailand attempted to tighten the law by adding new criteria used to qualify companies as foreign referring not only to ownership limitation but also to the majority of voting rights and management controls. In addition, the Thai authorities have put in place various harassment and tracking procedures implying obligations for companies with foreign shareholding of 40% and above to disclose the source of funding of Thai shareholders. Similar procedures are aimed at addressing specific problem of the acquisition of land by foreigners. Furthermore, EU investors are put at a disadvantage vis-&agrave;-vis U.S. investors who still benefit from national treatment provisions in the US-Thailand Treaty of Amity 1968 with regard to establishing and acquiring interests in enterprises of all types for engaging in commercial, industrial, financial and other business activities, with the exception of a few sectors (inland transportation and communication industries, banking involving depository functions, fiduciary functions, business of inland communication, domestic trade in indigenous agricultural products and exploiting land or other natural resources), although the WTO derogation from Art.

However, some regulators could be very protective e.g. in telecommunications where the regulator has introduced foreign dominance criteria (e.g. management control, using preferential stock with different voting rights to control, etc.) in addition to the equity ownership, which is the only general criterion in Thailand's GATS commitments. The regulator in civil aviation also plans to introduce foreign dominance criteria in air transport services similarly to the one in the telecommunications by October 2016. Thailand is free to regulate in the air transport services as there is no international commitment made on Mode 3 of the sector (except for some activities like maintenance or selling and marketing of air transport services).

After formal WTO consultations in 2008 on the valuation of spirits, Thailand quickly adhered to correct valuation practices. However, other problems have been encountered with in other products sold between non-related parties, such as cars where systematic wrong-doing, in terms of undervalued invoicing, is consistently reported and has lead to increase in parallel imports, concerns on unfair competition and creation of 'grey markets'. In this respect, we are also concerned about a number of proposed amendments to the liquor law. In particular, we fear that increasing the Excise Department's powers to assess the taxable base by granting powers to the DG of Excise Department to reassesses CIF price for excise purposes can reintroduce from the back door the illegal systematic use of construed value that was abandoned by Customs. Similar concerns relate to valuation of cars manufactured in the free zones by the Excise Department.</div>\n<div><br /><u><strong>2) Customs reward and penalty schemes: </strong></u>Thai customs has an incentive program rewarding officials for identifying importers suspected of false declaration of origin, false product classification, or false customs valuation. As the reward is based on a percentage of the recovered revenues/penalties (between 10 and 55%), the maximisation of the latter is encouraged. In practice, therefore, Customs officials have a strong incentive to use all means available (i.e., criminal law and threats with significant retroactive Customs penalties) to investigate importers who are alleged to have committed the aforementioned offences. Concerning the penalties charged on smuggled goods, in the past importers and exporters found to have smuggled goods would be fined four times of the value of the goods including tax, which was considered very high, particularly in cases where operators had no intention to violate the law. The Customs Department has proposed amending the Customs Act B.E. 2469 (1926), last amended in 2005 to set a cap for the reward as well as to reduce these penalties based upon certain factors such as the degree of seriousness of the offense. However, we feel that the proposed cap on reward scheme is far too high and continues to provide an incentive for misuse of the mechanisms and even corruption among enforcement authorities.</div>\n<div><br /><u><strong>3) Dual standard practices of Rules of Origin/ local content:</strong></u> EU companies manufacturing and assembling cars in Thailand in the Customs Free Zone are affected by different practices by different Thai authorities when applying preferential rules of origin. When the car is intended for exports outside of Thai territory (i.e. in other ASEAN countries or even exported to 3rd countries including EU), it would be deemed to have fulfilled the Thai/ASEAN origin requirement (40% local content, whatever the actual origin of this local content) and certified as such, whereas when the identical car produced under the same conditions is imported into the Thai territory, the Thai Customs will refuse to recognise the Thai/ASEAN origin of the products by imposing more stringent conditions for the local content. Similar difficulties in inconsistent application of cost calculation methods in determining origin have been raised by other manufacturers, such producers of optical lenses.</div>\n<div><br /><u><strong>4) The de minimis threshold: </strong></u>The Thai Customs apply a de minimis regime that exempts goods with the value of 1,000 THB (around Euro 25) or less from formal entry procedures. This amount is considered to be too low to facilitate trade and reduce costs in particular for SMEs and free up resources for Customs. The EU therefore encourages the Thai Government to raise its de minimis threshold to a level comparable with regional standards (i.e. 3,000 THB or 75 Euro) in order to enhance supply-chain connectivity.</div>",

In addition to the documents foreseen in the Agreement, the Algerian authorities request a \"franchise\" document from the exporters in order to grant them the preferential market access (import rate) put in place by the Agreement. The EU exporters, in order to avoid&nbsp; payment of 15% costume duties, have to obtain a &ldquo;franchise&rdquo; from the Algerian Commercial Bureau (DCP). In order to apply for it, they have to provide several documents, including an EUR1 and Certificate of origin. The EUR1 is delivered once the exported products are loaded and ready to leave the port (the export operation is imminent). The issuance of the franchise takes additional 7 to 10 days (according to information shared by steel exporters). This situation leads to an increase of the logistic cost related to the export operation (charter a ship for much longer period than ususally necessary).</p>\n<p>HS: 72142000 - 25232100</p>",

            "description": "<p>Since October 2013, some EU exporters are facing a commercial barrier despite the preferential trade agreement between Algeria and the EU. In addition to the documents foreseen in the Agreement, the Algerian authorities request a \"franchise\" document from the exporters in order to grant them the preferential market access (import rate) put in place by the Agreement. The EU exporters, in order to avoid&nbsp; payment of 15% costume duties, have to obtain a &ldquo;franchise&rdquo; from the Algerian Commercial Bureau (DCP). In order to apply for it, they have to provide several documents, including an EUR1 and Certificate of origin. The EUR1 is delivered once the exported products are loaded and ready to leave the port (the export operation is imminent). The issuance of the franchise takes additional 7 to 10 days (according to information shared by steel exporters). This situation leads to an increase of the logistic cost related to the export operation (charter a ship for much longer period than ususally necessary).</p>\n<p>HS: 72142000 - 25232100</p>",

According to the WTO SPS Agreement, Members should base their SPS measures on international standards and should not unjustifiably discriminate between Members. Also, the import procedures are burdensome and unnecessarily lengthy for the EU. This procedure is against WTO SPS Agreement, related to Annex C: control, inspection and approval procedures.

According to the WTO SPS Agreement, Members should base their SPS measures on international standards and should not unjustifiably discriminate between Members.

This is giving rise to broad discretional criteria of the court to fix this amount, which creates a situation of legal uncertainty for foreign firms.

The reform provides for liability of internet service providers (ISP), increases sanctions, and regulates the extent and scope of private copies. However, it is necessary to strengthen measures against digital piracy and ensure effective action to address illegal content on the internet. A system of notifications by ISPs to subscribers suspected of infringing copyright material came into effect in 2012 and is being used by the six major ISPs representing 95% of the fixed broadband market. The government ran a major public awareness campaign about this system. It is hoped that this system will be effective and avoid a certain number of court cases as having to resort to court orders to take-down illegal material from the internet is time consuming and costly. More enforcement on the streets is necessary. The proper implementation of the law and the notification system has to be monitored carefully.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The modified Copyright Law introduces civil and criminal remedies; rules on liability of online intermediaries; mediation and arbitration procedures; rules on collective management societies; increase in all applicable fines; no discrimination between the physical and the digital environment; higher sanctions for piracy on a commercial scale; a list of exceptions and limitations to copyright.</p>\n<p>Internet piracy occurs most significantly via peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing of infringing content, but also through hosted sites and, increasingly, illegal mobile downloads. Chile&rsquo;s amended Copyright Law creates a \"notice plus notice\" architecture but lacks the threat of any real consequences for typical online piracy and fails to impute liability upon an ISP that gains knowledge of infringement outside of a court order. The Chilean law provides for no sanctions in case the online intermediary does not give notice to the infringer within the deadline of 5 days.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned factors cause concerns about the effectiveness of the rules providing for the liability of online intermediaries. However, a system of notification to subscribers suspected of infringing copyright came into effect in 2012 and is used by the six major ISPs. The private sector is concerned with the need for the involvement of the judicial system (court order) which is a lengthy and costly process and hopes that the notification system will prove effective in reducing online piracy.</p>\n<p>On enforcement, Chile does not envisage the creation of a specialised enforcement agency on ISP liability or any adoption of implementing regulations thereon. Although there is some good cooperation with Chilean criminal and civil enforcement authorities, additional resources are needed to raise street actions and increased prioritization on the part of the judiciary. Police and customs officials take ex officio actions on a regular basis and involve rights holders in legal procedures. However, more enforcement actions would be needed against Internet sites. Prosecutions for copyright crimes are too infrequent and rarely result in deterrent sentencing and civil actions face procedural obstacles and delays.</p>",

The proper implementation of the law and the notification system has to be monitored carefully.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The modified Copyright Law introduces civil and criminal remedies; rules on liability of online intermediaries; mediation and arbitration procedures; rules on collective management societies; increase in all applicable fines; no discrimination between the physical and the digital environment; higher sanctions for piracy on a commercial scale; a list of exceptions and limitations to copyright.</p>\n<p>Internet piracy occurs most significantly via peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing of infringing content, but also through hosted sites and, increasingly, illegal mobile downloads. Chile&rsquo;s amended Copyright Law creates a \"notice plus notice\" architecture but lacks the threat of any real consequences for typical online piracy and fails to impute liability upon an ISP that gains knowledge of infringement outside of a court order. The Chilean law provides for no sanctions in case the online intermediary does not give notice to the infringer within the deadline of 5 days.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned factors cause concerns about the effectiveness of the rules providing for the liability of online intermediaries. However, a system of notification to subscribers suspected of infringing copyright came into effect in 2012 and is used by the six major ISPs. The private sector is concerned with the need for the involvement of the judicial system (court order) which is a lengthy and costly process and hopes that the notification system will prove effective in reducing online piracy.</p>\n<p>On enforcement, Chile does not envisage the creation of a specialised enforcement agency on ISP liability or any adoption of implementing regulations thereon. Although there is some good cooperation with Chilean criminal and civil enforcement authorities, additional resources are needed to raise street actions and increased prioritization on the part of the judiciary. Police and customs officials take ex officio actions on a regular basis and involve rights holders in legal procedures. However, more enforcement actions would be needed against Internet sites. Prosecutions for copyright crimes are too infrequent and rarely result in deterrent sentencing and civil actions face procedural obstacles and delays.</p>",
