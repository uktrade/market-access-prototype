Onward transport has been delayed at San Francisco, New York, Delaware and Houston.\r\n\r\nWhile no reason has been given for this, it seems likely that officials are concerned about the possibility of products sourced in China being exported under an EU flag. In particular, officials are paying particular attention to document GB34, which lists the components in each product and their countries of origin. Any consignment with this document not fully completed and attested are at risk of severe delay.",
