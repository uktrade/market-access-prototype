            "description": "The Russian Federation rejects imports&nbsp;of live pigs, pig products and derivates from the whole EU. Concerning Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia it has issued relevant notifications of its import bans to the WTO, specifying that the bans are based on the outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF). As regards the other EU Member States, there is a de-facto ban of such products.\n&nbsp;The EU considers the measures adopted by the Russian Federation as: \n- disproportionate, as an EU-wide ban, restricting the trade in live pigs and pig products from any unaffected part of the European Union, is unjustified and unnecessary. This is particularly so given the comprehensive steps that have been taken to fulfil the international guidelines that regulate such situations, namely regionalisation. The EU has put in place strict control measures including intense surveillance, movement controls etc.\n&nbsp;- it is not science based as it goes beyond the OIE guidelines on ASF without scientific justification.\n- it is far more trade restrictive than necessary. Even if the restrictions in place were limited, as claimed by Russia in its notification, to solely the Member States affected by ASF&nbsp; it would remain more trade restrictive than necessary. As affected EU Member States have been regionalised, the remaining areas of these Member States - that is, those outside the regionalised area - should be free to trade.\n- it is also discriminatory as the Russian Federation is itself a territory where ASF is present and it does not apply similar measures domestically, but allows for regionalisation. In fact, the Russian Federation has been regularly notifying ASF cases since 2007, both in wild boar and domestic pigs.\nResearch on the virus detected in the wild boars in the EU seem to indicate that the virus found indeed originates from Russia, and was later transmitted to the European Union via Belarus. The restriction is compounded by the July 2014 political embargo.\nThe EU made intensive efforts to reach out to Russian authorities. When this proved fruitless, the EU opened a dispute settlement case in WTO. The panel report was published in August 2016 and ruled overwhelmingly in favour of the EU. \nThe Russian Federation appealed the report in September 2016. The appeal procedure is ongoing.",

            "description": "Despite some improvements in the Russian IPR regime (legislation and court rulings), numerous problems continue to hamper the effective protection of intellectual property rights in Russia, in particular in terms of enforcement.\nRussia has made some progress in addressing the mass replication of counterfeit optical disks on its territory and that of the Customs Union. However, internet piracy (including but not limited to social networks) remains a great concern, and there is only piecemeal progress at best with regard to the goal of approximating Russian copyright legislation in this area to EU and US models.\nSale and use of counterfeit goods using trademarks for clothes, luxury products, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals products are also widespread and take place both in street markets and in mainstream retail. Furthermore, systematic infringements of patents, commercial secrets and know-how in innovative sectors such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, mechanical engineering and the IT industry continue to injure EU businesses.\nThere is also misappropriation of intellectual property rights through obtaining patents for alleged inventions or through registering trademarks that are identical or strikingly similar to the trademarks of foreign companies.\nThe establishment of the Customs Union between Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus on 1 January 2010 (the Eurasian Economic Union since 2015) has on balance created additional risks for IPR protection. The borders of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan continue to be under-patrolled, allowing for entry of counterfeit goods and for illegitimate parallel imports from Asian countries, notably China.\nRussia's accession to the WTO and the creation of the new Russian IPR Court in early 2013 could over time prove positive developments.",

The draft says that national regime for foreign countries should apply under the conditions provided for by Russia's international treaties, and that the Russian Government could establish conditions for access of goods ands services originating in foreign countries to public procurement.&nbsp;\nThe new law on Russia's federal contractual system was then adopted by the Russian Duma on 22 March 2013 in second reading, and signed by the President on 5 April 2013. The new law in Article 14 stipulates that national treatment will be extended to foreign goods and services if and only if a specific international agreement Russia is a party to explicitly says so. Furthermore, a list detailing such specific international agreements will be established and published by the competent Russian agency for public procurement. These rules are a deterioration of the situation of EU businesses in Russia compared to the status quo ante. Russia has committed itself to join the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and notify this intention to the WTO Government Procurement Committee at the time of accession. Russia would become an observer to the GPA and would initiate negotiations for membership within four years of its accession. Russian government agencies would, upon accession, award contracts in a transparent manner.\nSince July 2014 Russia has introduced restrictions for foreign companies to participate in public procurements in the following sectors:\n\nMedical devices &ndash; Gov.

These concerns increased with the introduction by the EU of the Export Control System on 1 July 2009. This electronic system eliminates altogether the paper export declarations in order to facilitate customs procedures on the European side. As a result, an increasing number of companies have been facing difficulty at customs clearance in Russia, unable to present the requested document.",

The EU has in place a charging scheme for heavy goods vehicles, but it applies to all hauliers irrespective of their nationality.\nSince November 2015, the Platon system has entered into force. Trucks over 12 tonnes have to pay a fee for the use of Federal roads. GLONASS devices have to be used, and other conditions apply. After problems in the initial period, it would appear that the system is not implemented in a manner that penalises foreign carriers. There is however an additional fee for trucks between 3.5 and 12 tonnes that only targets foreign hauliers, and there are concerns that the fees (as well as penalties for non-payment) are disproportionately high if compared to the road taxes that Russian vehicles pay &ndash; thus, discriminatory.

This remains a relevant issue although the situation has evolved since 2008. Russian customs increasingly rely on average prices for the purposes of customs valuation and there is a tendency to revise upwards declared values because customs officers have been made by law personally liable for any undervaluation. Various goods are concerned such as waters, soda ash, machinery, light bulbs etc. In parallel Russia has adopted a new legislation (February 2016) imposing personal responsibilities on customs officials registering the customs declaration.

            "description": "SA authorities take several years to evaluate questionnaires used in the negotiations of import permits and health certificates by new applicants (such as in the case of a number of EU MS). For pork and other meats, SA operates a queue system with no indication of duration for the handling of the application. SA authorities affirm that delays are due to lack of resources and that no applicant is treated more favourably than others.\nWith regards to pork, the process has been particular slow and restrictive due to SA rules on PRRS control. PL questionnaires have been validated in 2016, while discussions commenced in 2004. The final report is being completed and draft health certificates are being finalised. The queue currently comprises AT, SE and FI. AT has been waiting for more than four years. In the case of SE and FI (which are PRRS free according to OIE), SA has explained that declaration of freedom may have a positive impact only when the assessment starts but would not warrant fast-tracking because Sweden and Finland, being part of the EU market, are exposed to free circulation from other EU MS.\nRegarding poultry, Lithuania has applied for import of poultry and poultry products in 2012 and still waiting.\nRegarding beef, contrary to reassurances by SA, new health certificates are not yet available to Member States whose BSE status under OIE has improved and despite the fact that SA's cabinet has authorised DAFF to issue them. DAFF indicated further information might be required on use of animal protein and slaughterhouses. Application for IT Bresaola has been pending for a long time &ndash; IT has been number 8 on the list for 3 years now. The SA authorities consider Bresaola to be fresh meat &ndash; resulting from a dispute on the temperatures for treatment. DAFF requires 70 degrees, which also poses issues with mortadella.\nSA also insists that the EU needs to explain how BSE and other EU SPS controls are addressed in intra-community trade. SA requires information on how EU MS with different risk profiles manage imports among them and monitor exports to third countries which may ensue. As long as such explanation is provided, BSE status of all EU countries will be kept at levels which may be higher than the ones claimed individually under OIE and a declaration of freedom would have limited, if any impact. The SA authorities (DAFF) had told France that a mission to the EU would be sent to look into the issue.\nWith regards to poultry, DAFF is refusing to resume imports from the NL after declaration of freedom from HPAI, contrary to past practice. In a letter to industry, reference is made to the \"plight of the (local poultry) industry\" (which has already led to the imposition of antidumping and provisional safeguard duties). It would thus appear that SPS issues are going to be used as trade defence measures. DAFF has announced intention to go to a fact finding mission to EU MS to verify freedom.\n**Although not adressed in a FTA, the EPA provides for enhanced co-operation on SPS matters and the establishment of an SPS co-operation committee**",

The PPS currently introduces a discount of 30% for steel scrap and of 25% for aluminium scrap.\nThe policy, aimed at securing the local industry with competitive scrap metal, will be in place for five years. At the end of this period, it will be reviewed to determine whether it should be terminated or extended for a limited period, with or without amendment.\nCurrently, almost all export permits for copper-based scrap metal, and all export permits for ferrous scrap metal from the inland area are being declined due to offers to purchase at preference prices by domestic consumers.\nThe Metal Recyclers' Association of South Africa (MRA) is in litigation against ITAC, the departments of economic development and of trade and industry and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa over these export restrictions.\nThe International Trade Administration (ITAC) is currently considering even more onerous draft rules, published in December 2015 for comment (deadline February 2016), which include, among other, the requirement that all scrap metals for which an export permit has been granted be exported through the port of Port Elizabeth.\nExports restrictions for designated commodities are also being considered under the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act Amendment Bill.",

Mercosur decisions of 2010 foresee that members can temporarily apply a list of 100 exceptions to the CET until 31 December 2015, what has been recently prolonged until 31 December 2021 (Mercosur&acute;s Common Market Council Decision 26/2015).\nEvery 6 months 20% of the Common MERCOSUR Nomenclature (NCM) tariff lines can be modified. The impact for European exporters is significant in terms of lost export opportunities and additional duties, in addition possible modifications cause uncertainty regarding tariffs.\nBackground\nBrazil applies the MERCOSUR Common External Tariff (CET) expressed in the Common MERCOSUR Nomenclature (NCM), which is based on the Harmonized System (HS). Mercosur decisions CMC 56/10, CMC 58/10 and 26/2015 of 16 July 2015 allow MERCOSUR members to temporarily apply a list of number of exceptions to the CET until 31 December 2021 (so-called &ldquo;LETEC list&rdquo;). Based on this decision Brazil is allowed to apply up to 100 exceptions (tariff lines). Every 6 months 20% of the NCM tariff lines can be modified which leads to an uncertainty regarding possibly affected products in the future. This measure discriminates imports with regard to local products.\nBrazil has recently given up on earlier expressed plans for further CET exemptions increases, however it still maintains around 23% of its LETEC exemptions as tariff increases. Due to a recent currency devaluation Brazil seems&nbsp;not to enact any new import tariffs increases and to consider lowering some existing ones. Nevertheless, tariffs are only one of a number of trade restrictive instruments applied against imports that include discriminatory indirect taxation, increased use of trade defence instruments and numerous notifications of new technical regulations to the WTO&nbsp;among others.",

            "description": "In 2004, the EU launched a WTO case against the US&nbsp;Government' support to the aerospace industry (DS353). The case&nbsp;relates to WTO-incompatible support&nbsp;to Boeing, on which a WTO panel issued its final public report on 31 March 2011, followed by the Appellate Body report on 12 March 2012. The EU&nbsp;challenged various US Federal, State and local subsidies benefitting Boeing, totalling -&nbsp;as confirmed by the AB report - USD 5-6 billion in WTO-inconsistent subsidies disbursed between 1989 and 2006. Moreover, further subsidies to be granted in the period 2006-2024 are estimated to amount to at least USD3.1 billion.&nbsp;More specifically:\n\nNASA has provided Boeing with more than USD2.6 billion in subsidies through eight NASA-funded federal research programmes through direct payments and free access to facilities, equipment and employees.&nbsp;The AB confirmed that these programmes provided subsidies in the form of a direct transfer of funds or the provision of goods and services by NASA to Boeing for which no fee is payable and for which Boeing acquired the commercial IP rights.\nThe US Department of Defence (DOD) under its Research Development, Test and Evaluation programmes has transferred to Boeing, at no cost, dual use technology worth up to USD1.2 billion for direct use in Boeing's production of Large Civil Aircraft as well as free access to DOD's facilities.\nBoeing continued to benefit from USD2.2 billion in Foreign Sales Corporation export subsidies, despite previous WTO rulings that these are prohibited subsidies under WTO law.\nThe City of Wichita (Kansas) granted almost USD 500 million in the form of tax abatements on Industrial Revenue Bonds between 1989 and 2006.\nWashington State tax breaks for the period 2006-24 amount to a subsidy value of close to USD3.1 billion. (Substitute Senate Bill 5952 of 9 November 2013 has since extended these tax breaks through 2040, at an estimated value of more than USD 8.7 billion).\n\nNASA and DOD research and development subsidies enabled Boeing to develop key technologies, without which it would not have been possible to launch the 787 \"Dreamliner\" in 2004.These research subsidies gave Boeing a competitive advantage causing Airbus to lose sales campaigns, thus losing sales of the A330 and A350 models (200-300 seat market) and threatening to lose its share of certain export markets. Even where it was able to make sales, it had to make them at reduced prices because of the presence of the subsidized 787 on the market.&nbsp;The AB has also confirmed that the Washington Tax subsidies and Foreign Sales Corporation subsidies, as well as the Wichita subsidies, enabled Boeing to beat Airbus to winning orders in the \"single aisle\" 100-200 seat market (Boeing 737 vs A320).&nbsp;Boeing's illegal subsidies adversely impacts sales, market share and prices of Airbus' A320, A320 neo, A330, A350XWB and the A380 families of Large Civil Aircraft (LCA).",

            "description": "Import surveillance certificate regime consists in a requirement to obtain a surveillance license prior to the import of different products if their price is below a certain threshold defined by the authorities via different communiqu&eacute;s. The scope of this mechanism is broad. The Turkish authorities put regularly in place communiqu&eacute;s through which different products enter in the scope of this measure.\nPrior to the import operation, and if the imported products' price is below the above mentioned threshold, the importer has to apply for a surveillance license to the Ministry of Economy. The application file contains information about the importer, the declarant (if different than the importer), the exporter, the producer and information about the imported product. Documents such as the original or notary-certified copy of the list of the authorized signatures of declarant, copies of the proforma invoice or the commercial invoice concerning the product to be imported should be provided with the application for surveillance certificate. However, additional information and documents may be requested by the Turkish authorities. This makes the measure similar to a non-automatic licence.\nConcerning textile products, there is a slightly different system for surveillance while it also results in replacement of a reference price if the invoice value is below the reference price calculated at the registration. At the beginning of 2009 the Communiqu&eacute; on registration requirements for textile and clothing product importers to Turkey was renewed and a requirement was added whereby all EU exporters to Turkey are required to register with the Turkish Exporters Association by filling in certain forms. Only once the registration is done, the export can take place. This measure is in force since 1 January 2009 and has since been renewed yearly. &nbsp;",

            "description": "On 13 January 2011, the Turkish Under-secretariat of Foreign Trade (later restructured as Ministry of Economy)&nbsp;published in the Official Gazette the Communiqu&eacute; on&nbsp;initiation of two&nbsp;safeguard investigations (no. 2011/1 and&nbsp; no. 2011/2). These Communiqu&eacute;s suggested the application of temporary measures by means of a decision&nbsp;increasing duties for goods belonging to HS codes 51.11, 51.12, 52.08, 52.09, 52.10, 52.11, 54.07, 54.08, 55.12, 55.13, 55.14, 55.15 , 55.16 and 61.01, 61.02, 61.03, 61.04, 61.05, 61.06, 61.07, 61.08, 61.09, 61.10, 61.12, 62.01, 62.02, 62.03, 62.04, 62.05, 62.06, 62.07, 62.08 , 62.11. This was followed by the Decision Number 2011/1476 of 24 March 2011 which established that additional customs duties would&nbsp;be provisionally&nbsp;collected. The measure was rendered definite as of 15 September 2011 not as a safeguard measure but in the form&nbsp; of tariff increases (MFN rates). Products originating in the EU of FTA partners of Turkey are not subject to additionatal duties. However, products originating in&nbsp;third countries are subject to additional duties when imported via the EU even if they were in free circulation in the EU.\nAt that time, Turkey also extended the product range (headings included in chapters 30,52,53,58,59 and 60).\nThe Turkish authorities decided (Decision no: 2012/3188 of 1 June 2012) that additional customs duty shall not be levied on goods originating in the countries that are included in a system of diagonal cumulation in the context of the FTAs to which Turkey is a party and imported via teh EU, provided that a proof of preferential status of the goods is submitted. In practical terms, this means that the additional duties will not be charged to goods originated in the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean area. Even though this decision was welcomed as a positive development by the EU, the situation remains the same for goods coming from countries not included in Decision 2012/3188, such as the ones to which Turkey has granted preferences under the Generalized System of Preferences.\nOver 630 tariff lines are affected by this measure and mainly the following: woven/knitted fabrics (semi-finished textiles) made from wool, cotton or (artificial and synthetic) man-made fibres; Ready-made apparel, such as coats, anoraks, pullovers, cardigans, vests, tracksuits, ski suits, swimwear, underwear, children&rsquo;s clothing, ties, bed and table linen. 54 % of all tariff lines in the textile and apparel sector (Section XI of the Combined Nomenclature) are covered by the measure.\nAfter that, additional custom duties have been imposed since 2014 on a broad range of other products such as footwear, tyres, furniture, home appliances cosmetics, stationery products, certain steel products, accessories for vehicles and miscellaneous products etc. covered by 17 different decisions.\nThis barrier is particularly important for the footwear industry.\nAdditional customs duties of 10%, 30% and 50% on certain footwear products have been applied&nbsp;since August 2014. Footwear originating from EU or FTA partners is not subject to additional duties, but products originating from countries benefiting from GSP preferences are.\nOn 1 September, Turkey extended the scope of additional duties on footwear by extending it to additional tariff codes 6406 1090 and 6406 9030. Additional duty of 20% will be applied to the countries excluding EU, EFTA and other FTA partners.",

In practice this means that it takes approximately two years to register one brand while registration procedures for locally produced spirits take on average two weeks.\nThe following documents are required to register one brand:\n\nPower of attorney from the manufacturer to the distributor authorizing them to register the product on their behalf.\nFree Sale Certificate.\nCertificate of Method of Manufacture.\nCertificate of explanation for lot code.\nSafety certificate from suppliers (for bottles and glasses). Note: Generally, it should suffice for the manufacturer of the final product to guarantee safety of all its components, in this case, the authorities require the certificates to be submitted from the manufacturer of each component, and this is an unusual requirement which delays the process considerably.\nLabels of the product.\nCertification of the type of product being registered and the applicable regulation in Ecuador.\n\nEcuador also formally requested (without any prior notification) that imported spirits include quantitative unit ingredient declaration which means that every constituent has now to be followed by a %. In the case of whisky this would be for water, alcohol and caramel. Although EU spirits producers have demonstrated that the amount of caramel colour is marginal and hence does not alter the volume of the other two components (60% water, 40% whisky), we are now under the obligation to declare an additional 0.05% of caramel which is erroneous from a composition perspective.\nEcuador also started to question the way ingredients are currently listed on the certificates and the labels, as they claim that &ldquo;whisky&rdquo; is not an ingredient but the final product. Given that whisky is a single ingredient product, ingredients listing should not be required where the product name and the ingredient list are the same (e.g. whisky) as it is clearly stated on the pack &ndash; the &ldquo;ingredients: Whisky&rdquo; requirement on the back is thus a burdensome repetition that does not provide any additional information to the consumer.\n&nbsp;",

These practices include:&bull; Lack of transparency for many of the boards decisions, particularly regarding listing and delisting measures; &bull; Limited product listings for imported products with onerous conditions imposed on suppliers to apply for a listing (if an imported product is not listed by the provincial liquor board, it is not allowed to be sold in the province).&bull; The liquor boards use their position as monopolies and, in the case of Ontario and Quebec as the largest and second largest single purchasers in the world of alcoholic beverages, to practically impose additional onerous commercial conditions on suppliers, once an imported product is listed;&bull; Lower product mark-ups applied by some liquor boards on wine and&nbsp;domestic spirits than on wine and imported spirits (e.g. Ontario, Quebec,&nbsp; British Colombia and Nova Scotia).&bull; Extra cost-of-service charges on imported products the application of which are not always fully transparent and which are not justified by liquor board audits [NOTE:CETA CHANGES THIS];&bull; In addition, for wine and spirits, the application by some liquor boards of this extra cost-of-service charge on imports on an ad valorem basis. Since most of such costs (e.g. handling) do not depend upon the value of the product, the application of such a charge on this basis means that it is &lsquo;unjustifiably&rsquo; higher on higher-valued products (including most European products);&bull; Furthermore, this extra cost-of-service charge on imports is also applied by some liquor boards prior to the application of an across-the-board percentage charge. This has the effect of almost doubling this extra cost-of-service on imports in the final price; &bull; Restrictions on private delivery and on access to points of sale that may not apply to domestic products.&bull; Minimum (and maximum) price requirements on certain imported products&bull; The waiver or reduction of various charges to the domestic industry (e.g. freight, direct delivery mark ups, costs of marketing programmes) not available to imported products. &bull;&nbsp;Restrictions on private delivery and on access to points of sale that normally do not apply to domestic products. Sales of EU wines are only possible via the liquor boards while domestic products in some provinces can be sold either through private outlets, farmers markets or enjoy better selling space in supermarkets (British Columbia). [note: Wine producing provinces like Ontario and Quebec, permit direct sales of Canadian wines in their place of production; in British Colombia and Ontario a limited number of off-site private stores has been granted to the wine producers and in Quebec, wine that is bottled in the province, can be sold in grocery stores; a number of provinces also allow the sale of Canadian wine at farmers markets, while sales of EU wines is only possible via the liquor boards. Though the prices in the private outlets are required to be the same as in the liquor boards, some product mark-up are not applied in the private sales outlets resulting in a more lucrative route-to-market available only to domestic wines: these practices are allowed however under our 1989 bilateral agreement].\n&bull; Ontario authorises the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) to apply an additional reduction of 5% on all sales of Ontarian wines to restaurants and bars.New selling formats such as bag-in-a-box one is hardly available for imported wines in Ontario.&bull; New sales targets reflect double-standard for Ontario vs imported wines.&nbsp;Wines risk to be routinely de-listed for failure to reach the quota.All of these discriminatory practices raise the cost of imports and hinder entry into the Canadian market by producers of European alcoholic beverages, thus putting them at a competitive disadvantage vis-&agrave;-vis domestic suppliers and partly also vis-&agrave;-vis importers from third countries (mainly NAFTA).",

The notification omits to mention Decree 59/2016, which lays out the rules and practicalities surrounding the new control stamp regime.\n&nbsp;The industry has two major concerns regarding the new regime:&nbsp;\n\nThe proposed date of implementation of the new control seal regime is retrospective (14th September 2016), and is the same as the date of publication of the rules surrounding the control stamp regime in Decree 59/2016. It seems the measure was already in force at the time of the WTO Notification.\nThe control stamp regime in Decree 59/2016 does not comply with WTO law. It discriminates overtly through different prices charged for control stamps to imported and domestic producers of &lsquo;like&rsquo; beverage categories. The price differences applied in Euros, per 1000 stamps, are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nAlcoholic beverages\n\n\nSpirit drinks\n\n\nBeer\n\n\nWine\n\n\n\n\nDomestic\n\n\n15.30\n\n\n6.85\n\n\n12.25\n\n\n\n\nImported\n\n\n29.68\n\n\n9.57\n\n\n27.07\n\n\n\n\n\nA final concern exists with the lack of flexibility in the application of the control seal.

In addition, market restrictions apply in the departments or local subdivisions of Colombia. The departments impose market-access restrictions that distort the competitive conditions in the market to the detriment of EU spirits. This is in contravention of Colombia's non-discrimination obligations under WTO rules.\nIn October 2016, after a long-lasting process, the Colombian Senate approved a new Law on Liquors which eliminates the discriminatory treatment of imported spirits and provides for a differentiated tax treatment for wines and spirits. On 21 November 2016, the Congress passed a law reforming the spirits regime in Colombia (\"reform law\") that will enter into force on 1 January 2017.\nMoreover, in 2016, unequal treatment&nbsp;of imported beers has been reported from several departments which&nbsp;adopted discriminatory provisions against imported beers through local legislation acts (ordenanzas, resolutions and circular notes). These measures include strip stamps, exclusively for imported beers, which result in higher costs and burdensome administrative procedures. Currently 11 departments (Caldas, Quind&iacute;o, Tolima, Nari&ntilde;o, Norte de Santander, Cauca, Boyac&aacute;, Guajira, Caquet&aacute;, Casanare and Cesar) request strip stamps on each can of beer, whereas 4 departments (Santander, Risaralda, Meta and Huila) have mixed systems with strip stamps on each six-pack of beer. Despite efforts to tackle the measure with the Federation of Departments and the Ministry of Trade, only 1 department (Atl&aacute;ntico) has lifted the measure so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThis matter has been raised during the EU-Colombia/Peru Market Access Committee on 8 December 2016. Colombia indicated that these departmental measures should be reviewed in line with national legislation and that it is currently reviewing possible actions.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;",

So far Russia has trade-restrictive measures based on unclear scientific backgrounds (MRLs for antibiotics, trade restrictions on certain categories of animals) or disproportionate enforcement decisions (MRLs for pesticides, microbiological findings). These practices are not compatible with modern norms and standards applicable to sanitary and phytosanitary field and pose a substantial burden to European exporters of agricultural and plant products to Russia.\nLack of certainty with regard to the norms and procedures in place has&nbsp;increased with the formation of the Customs Union (CU) on 1 January 2010, and adoption of harmonised CU SPS norms from 1 July 2010. The current uncertainty on the CU system and ongoing reform of the norms at a sustained rhythm creates difficulties for European exporters from preparing for the changes already in force and it is not sure whether transition periods sufficiently accommodate business needs.\nCertain audits by Russian services have led to a number of regional bans on different MS and commodities. As an example&nbsp;early 2013 Russia introduced a complete ban on the imports of fresh and chilled pig meat, beef and poultry meat from the entire territory of Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the EU has raised its concerns in relation to the ban RF had introduced in 2015 on the import of all fishery products from Latvia and Estonia, allegedly due to deficiencies detected during recent inspections.The EU and Member States have reached out for a more transparent process and increased trust in the EU system, highlighting that EU products are safe, and that Member States have a solid control system in place. Russia has not moved on these regional bans. The EU has raised specific trade concerns in the WTO SPS Committee, July 2016&nbsp;being the last occassion.\nNOTE: Most of commodities cannot be currently exported due to the 2014 Russian political embargo.

            "description": "Export of plant and plant products through Tanjung Priok port (Jakarta) are since early 2012 opened only to countries with a so-called Country Recognition Agreement (CRA). Other countries still might export through other ports in ID, but this leads to much more complicated trade flows.\nThe closure of Tanjung Priok Port is linked to the CRA, meaning that the imported products can enter Tanjung Priok Port as long as they are exported from countries having a CRA with ID. As of today there are 4 countries have concluded CRA with ID: US, Canada, Australia, and NZ. Consequently imports from those countries have access (but only for the specific products mentioned/listed in the CRA) to the main port of Tanjung Priok, Jakarta.\nNone of the EU MS have concluded a fully fledge CRA. A very limited number of commodities from certain MS have got access to Tanjung Priok Port through recognition of specific CRA. This status is based on the document completion and MoA on-site verification in those specific areas.\nIn practical terms, EU exports of fruits and vegetables are much hindered by this measure. Regulation No 4-2015 was key in setting up this very complex system. It has been replaced by Regulation 55/2016, which is the latest development in the field of imports of food of plant origin. The regulation covers basically fresh food of plant origin. (FPPO). \nIn case of FFPO, the system requires either a Country Recognition Agreement (CRA) OR an alternative system based on registration-approval of laboratories (ReLab) involved in the export chain, with systematic testing in every consignment. As an additional difference, countries with CRA ( or at least recognition of pest free areas) could access Jakarta Tanjung Priok port, while this would not be possible for countries approved via ReLab system. While obtaining a CRA would require systematically an audit, it is possible that recognition of the laboratory system did not need a mandatory audit (Indonesia was not very clear on this point).\nThe new 55/2016 introduced a third option, not explored yet, for exports without laboratory registration, but with more stringent consignment tests and import checks.\n&nbsp;Failure to obtain approval by Indonesia under any of these two systems implied an automatic trade ban as from February 2016.\nWhile some countries like BE have obtained registration of some laboratories, access to Tanjung Priok port is still an unresolved issue for the EU exports.",

            "description": "New legislation for food (Food Law 18/2012) self-sufficiency puts temporary ban on imports. The Food Law 18/2012 was adopted by Parliament (DPR) on 16 November 2012. It is very broad and impacts on all elements of food production, trade and marketing. It states, among others, that import and export of food shall only be done in accordance with national food needs. It further stipulates labelling requirements that are unclear (&rsquo;during entry&rsquo;) and notes a government &rsquo;obligation&rsquo; to stabilise food prices. Article 34 mandates that \"staple foods\" can only be exported if domestic consumption is fulfilled and national food reserves are sufficient. Food can only be exported after considering domestic food consumption and national interests. Article 36 mandates that food can only be imported if domestic production is insufficient or the item cannot be produced domestically. Articles 46/51/55/56/108- Allows and notes a government \"obligation\" to stabilize the supply and price of \"staple foods\". This can be done, among other ways, by price fixing, provision and management of food supply and food trading, establishment of tax/tariff policy in favour of national interests, and regulation of import and export. Article 55 protects income and buying power of Indonesian farmers and fishermen, whereas article 56 allows establishing tax and tariffs in favour of national interests.\nBurdensome registration and labelling requirements and import conditions for food products. The enforcement of food safety through food sanitation; control of food additives, genetically engineered food products and food irradiation; establishment of food packaging standard; issuing food quality and safety guarantee; and halal product guarantee for those required. Labelling requirements through putting the label inside and/or outside of the food package contains the product&rsquo;s name, list of used ingredients, net weight, date and production code, and halal (for those required).\nUnjustified import restrictions on a number of animals and animal products. Since 2001, Indonesia started applying an import ban on animals and a range of animal products where it considered there was a risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). While there is a certain progression towards international standards in Regulation 34/20146 there are still divergences. Indonesia requires absence of a number of diseases in a country or establishment for which OIE does not consider trade measures necessary. Indonesia introduced the principle of regionalisation in its legislation from 2009 only for Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and not for other diseases for which OIE also foresees this principle. As an example, it requires country freedom for African Swine Fever.\nLaw 18/2009 introduced burdensome and non-transparent risk assessment procedures for meat and dairy imports stemming from country establishment approval requirements. The criteria for passing the approval process are unclear, thus resulting in a long approval procedure. This is further compounded by the fact that Indonesia claims to lack resources for carrying out the audits. Law 18/2009 introduced a country and establishment approval entailing that every single exporting establishment need to be inspected. The procedure requires that foreign companies exporting fresh animal products (meat, dairy products, eggs etc.) have to register which are then to be submitted to plant-by-plant inspections. &nbsp;This system is again set in Regulation 34/2016\nIn addition, the import approval system is unclear and non/automatic. The regulation 58 2015, and later 6/2015, contain annexes with conditions for import of certain products of animal origin. For those products not mentioned in the Annex, the EU is seeking confirmation that they might not be eligible for import.\nIn addition, processing of EU export applications is extremely slow and not transparent. Audits are carried out establishment-based.\nThe EU, together with trading partners, has consistently raised the issue in all available fora, in bilateral meetings, at technical and political level. Latest occasion in a bilateral meeting 13 July 2017 in the margins of the WTO&nbsp; SPS Committee.",

Although Chapter 24 covers ten tariff lines, of particular concern to the industry (British American Tobacco) is the specific tariff line concerning cigarettes containing tobacco (HS 2402 20). The GCC decision appears to be conditional upon its consistency with the obligations of single GCC members under the WTO.\nOn 10 March 2016, Saudi Arabia was the first GCC member to implement the abovementioned amendment. Its WTO schedule binds cigarettes to a 200% ad valorem duty or a minimum specific rate of SR200/1,000 cigarettes, whichever is higher. In practice, it used to apply a 100% ad valorem duty with a minimum specific charge of SR100/1,000 cigarettes. Following the GCC amendment, Saudi Arabia applies a 100% ad valorem with a minimum specific charge of SR200/1,000 cigarettes. This does not appear to have given rise to any WTO compatibility concerns.&nbsp; Oman followed suit and recently doubled the minimum specific component of its external tariff for tobacco products. Oman's WTO schedule binds cigarettes to a 150% ad valorem duty. In practice, the country used to apply a 100% ad valorem duty with a minimum specific charge of OMR10/1,000 cigarettes. Following the GCC amendment, Oman is now applying a 100% ad valorem duty with a minimum specific charge of OMR20/1,000 cigarettes. The industry has reported that the resulting duty is, for cigarettes within a certain price range, higher than the bound 150% ad valorem rate.",

            "title": "Licensing procedures in financial services, telecommunication and postal and courier sectors",
            "description": "EU companies operating in several services sectors in China often face a complex, largely non-transparent and time-consuming licence approval process. Licensing procedures in China restrict the access of foreign companies either through limiting licences for foreign companies or through mandatorily requiring licences that foreign companies often cannot attain.&nbsp;\nThe following are examples of services sectors affected by this practice:\nFinancial services:Insurance: China introduced a new Insurance Law which took effect on 31 August 2014. The new law has rectified a number of issues that were of concern to the EU industry and should be welcomed. However, while some progress has been made in transparency and market access, the industry continues to report a number of problems.\nChina s insurance regulator (CIRC) in the case of life insurance impose requirement on ownership structure for foreign insurers which can only operate in China through a Joint Venture (JV) with a 50% equity cap for the foreign investor.\nOn March 2013 CIRC released Administrative Measures on Market Access of Insurance Company Branch Office, aiming to standardize the approval process for the establishment of insurance company branches which on the paper does not establish a different treatment for foreign companies. However, de facto, market access is still affected and different treatment continues.. We understand from stakehoders that normally foreign insurers can expect only one branch per year and per region to be approved by the regulator which is less favourable than what is granted to domestic insurers. Moreover, the process is still not transparent..\nBanking:\nIn January 2015, China amended the Administrative Regulations on Foreign Banks improving certain requirements regarding the opening of branches and licencing process including for RMB businesses. This amendment represents certain progress but it does not significantly ease foreign banks operations in China. Constrains for foreign banks are still high, The licensing processes for banks is still slow and intransparent with, overlapping responsibilities between the different regulators, Access to domestic bond underwriting is restricted and there are equity caps for acquiring a Chinese bank.\nTelecom:\n(1) Basic Telecom services: China is not open for European and other international carriers to access core telecommunications business operations and management. Although China&rsquo;s WTO commitments allow foreign participation up to 49%, basic telecommunication licenses have only been granted to the three state-owned telecom operators (China Telecom, China Unicom, China Mobile)+ CITIC. All these are state-owned and have only allowed for a minority shareholding by foreign telecom operators [which have even divested or decreased their holdings over recent years](2) Value-added Services (VAS): Foreign ICT companies face severe market access restrictions for provision value-added services. The VAS licence application process is cumbersome and limited in scope to certain services. Foreign ICT can only provide VAS services based on the VAS catalogue agreed on within the WTO whilst domestic companies can provide all services mentioned on the (broader) VAS classification list. Furthermore, foreign ICT companies have to form joint ventures with a 50% equity cap and a Chinese legal representative.(3) Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO): Although there does not seem to be de jure obstacle to get a MVNO licence, no foreign company (with the exception of a Taiwanese company) features in the 5 batches of MIIT licences giving the right to purchase, rebrand resale mobile communication services from infrastructure telecom service operators. On 8 February 2014, MIIT has released new regulations stating that China&rsquo;s burgeoning mobile virtual network operators will not be allowed to invest in the construction of mobile network infrastructure. MVNOs wishing to use the aforementioned infrastructure must purchase or rent network facilities provided from telecom operators that have already obtained approval to operate basic telecommunications services. The regulations also stipulate that handsets and other network access equipment supplied to MVNOs must gain network access approval from the MIIT. However, MIIT didn&rsquo;t publish this regulation officially and mentioned it in the approvals for MVNOs instead.\nPostal and courier services:\nThe postal law adopted on 24 April 2009 and in force since 1 October 2009 contains a ban for foreign operators to deliver letters domestically and it potentially raises issues of compatibility with China&rsquo;s WTO commitments. One of the main problems concerns the definition of the reserved area (i.e. activities potentially within China Post monopoly). Chinese implementing measures are being monitored very closely. It would be useful if China would clarify with implementing rules, the conditions under which express delivery companies are allowed to continue carrying out their operations without introducing any further restrictions or burdensome requirements especially via licensing procedures.The need for the express business operation permit, which is required under the Postal Law and by other relevant regulations, will bring huge burdens for enterprises and become the largest hindrance and bottleneck for industry development.\n&nbsp;",

            "title": "Raw Materials - export restrictions",
            "description": "China often uses trade restrictive measures, such as export duties and quotas on a broad range of key raw materials. These export restrictions affect all companies operating outside China, including EU companies. As a consequence, EU industry is facing difficulties in securing its supply of primary raw materials, especially when no alternative source of supply or no alternative raw material is available. The consequences of this policy extend to the supply of secondary raw materials.\nBesides export restrictions, the EU industry is also affected by the lack of transparency of regulations and procedures affecting various raw materials (e.g. Fluorspar), as well as some restrictions in investment.\nRecent reports also show that new discriminatory barriers for the Rare Earth processing industry have been set-up by the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). For example in the Inner Mongolia province, the pre-condition of any company to have their request for a permit evaluated, is that a well-known large local Rare Earths company is given a minimum of 51% share (without any capital investment). This is an unwritten rule that has effectively blocked any new FDI in the sector, even if the foreign companies fulfil all the legal requirements to be granted a permit for a processing plant.\nRaw materials currently subject to Chinese export restrictions either in the form of export quotas or export taxes include antimony, cobalt, copper, indium, lead, molybdenum, nickel, Rare Earths, silver, tin, tungsten and wood.\nThese restrictions have a significant detrimental impact for raw materials such as Rare Earths where China supplies &gt; 90% of world demand. Since 2000, China was applying production caps to regulate the supply of Rare Earths. It has also instated an export quota system, whereby Chinese companies (including foreign JVs) have to obtain a licence to export any Rare Earths. Licences are attributed separately to domestic producers/traders and to foreign JVs. As from 2007, China collects an export duty on Rare Earths, which - depending on the Rare Earth element - can vary between 15 and 25%. The export quotas were reduced significantly to ~ 30.000 MT from ~50.000 MT in 2012.\nIn January 2015, as part of the process of ensuring conformity with WTO rulings, China removed Rare Earths, molybdenum and tungsten from the system of export quotas, making them subject to licensing.

            "description": "Despite recent development in the Chinese public procurement regulatory framework, the main problem remains an active Buy Chinese policy where, in principle, only Chinese companies are allowed to bid in public tenders and foreign ones are only allowed under exceptions. Government agencies and related entities are required to purchase equipment and technology from Chinese state or privately owned manufacturing companies. There is limited access to public tenders and insufficient publicity of all public tenders. This barrier is related to the enforcement of the Government Procurement Law (GPL) adopted on 29 June 2002. Central and local entities tend to implement in a very broad manner those provisions, going far beyond discriminations imposed by the law. In addition, China does not yet undertake any substantial multilateral or bilateral commitment concerning government procurement. It submitted its WTO GPA (Government Procurement Agreement) initial offer end of December 2007, a revised offer in July 2010, second revised offer in November 2011etc. and most recently a fifth revised offer tabled in December 2014. However, despite important progress made the most recent offer is as regards the coverage still far from responding to EU expectations in terms of coverage.\nAnother issue with wide repercussions on the public procurement field is the implementation of the accreditation procedure for the indigenous innovative procurement scheme. A joint Circular of MOF, MOST and NDRC was issued in September 2009 detailing accreditation procedures to be followed in order to be eligible to tendering procedures. Among the requirements, IPR had to have Chinese origin (e.g. separate existence of brands and the obligation to have R&amp;D related to the IP included in the products located in China), requirement to disclose information related to innovation and IPR, thus exceeding by far standard demands for eligibility to government schemes. A notice issued by the State Council in November 2011, directing all government entitites to remove any mention of linkage between indigenous innovation policy and government procurement incentive measures within regulatory documents and to stop such implementation by 1st December 2011. Despite the efforts made the linkage remain a problem as this policy is still applied at sub central level in some of China&rsquo;s provinces.",

Despite some progress related to the implementation of the CCC, this remains a burdensome, expensive and time-consuming conformity assessment system, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Current requirements of the CCC system are not always related to the level of risk of the products, which implies that the CCC system is more trade restrictive than necessary.\nThe CCC touches many sectors such as automobiles, electrical/electronic products, machinery, ceramics and more recently ICT products. The system lacks flexibility and the same very heavy third-party certification procedure applies to very diverse categories of products, without any genuine consideration being given to the actual level of health and safety risk associated with them.\nIn 2013, CNCA officially said they had finished the review of CCC after 10 years&rsquo; practice; and will announce some changes to CCC scheme according to the risk assessment results conducted in 2012.\n\n(i) Products with lowest risk or not much relevant to safety would be removed from the CCC list\n(ii) Products with low risk would have less test or conformity process\n(iii) The frequency of factory inspection would be more flexible according to the risk assessment program based on the products and the capabilities of manufactures.\n(iv) Products with High risk would be had more test or surveillance.\n(v) Eight kinds of products have been removed from CCC scope in Aug. 2012.No. 117 CNCA 2012).\n\nFollowing the adoption of the first two revised implementing rules for low voltage switch gears and for tyres, the implementing rules for the other product categories under the CCC are being systematically revised. Hence, more progress could hopefully be expected in the future on reducing the number of products subject to the CCC and simplifying certification procedures for lower risk products.",

Many of them relate to cybersecurity. Generally, these measures include very broad and vague definitions, which create uncertainty and implicitly leaves the Chinese Authorities with the option of undermining foreign market access on the basis of unclear and broad considerations.&nbsp; These measures have raised a number of additional concerns such as mandatory requirements to use domestic cryptography only and to apply Chinese national standards instead of international standards, disclosure of source code, which would amount to the disclosure of business secrets, data localisation requirements, etc.\nThe &ldquo;Cyber Security Review System&rdquo;, announced in May 2014, is part of this trend. The IT banking guidelines was one of the first initiatives under this approach. They required domestic banks as well as foreign incorporated banks to progressively increase their expenditure on \"secure and controllable\" IT to reach the level of 75 % by 2019. The banking guidelines were suspended after strong international pressure, but China has issued a similar draft initiative for the insurance sector. Other sectors are also expected to follow.\nOther pieces of legislation include the Cyber Security Law, the Counter-terror Law, the Provisions on Administration of Web Publishing Services, the draft Internet News Information Services and the very recent Regulation on the Operation Behaviours in the Cloud Service Market.&nbsp;",

            "description": "China remains the EU&rsquo;s biggest challenge in the area of intellectual property rights. 66.12% of all counterfeit goods seized at European borders in 2013 came from China (mainland), and another 13.31% from Hong Kong. This phenomenon goes beyond lost revenues of IP stakeholders since a significant part of detained articles are products for daily use that could be potentially dangerous to the health and safety of consumers.\nEven though significant legislative progress has been made during recent years, IPR protection and enforcement is in many areas still not sufficiently effective. Lengthy registration proceedings and the burdensome legalisation of foreign documents are on-going problems. Substantial concerns exist in particular as regards the low quality standard required for innovation patent and as regards the IPR protection provided for data protection and trade secrets.\nEnforcement remains a very serious concern. Despite noteworthy efforts made by China, the access to the Chinese administrative and judicial enforcement system in China remains problematic for EU companies, notably for SMEs. In particular, notarisation and legalisation requirements make the defence of IPRs difficult and time-consuming for foreign right holders. Moreover, interim injunctions are difficult to obtain in practice, the damages awarded by the Courts remain often too low, and the execution of judicial decisions is burdensome. In some cases, signs of selective IPR enforcement are detected when state-owned enterprises or strategic areas are concerned.\nIn addition, the EU industry suffers from a long-standing discrepancy between the federal and the provincial protection level in China in terms of enforcement effectiveness and efficiency. The recent central anti-corruption campaigns and the creation of specific IPR Courts in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou give hope for a more harmonized level of protection in the future.",

            "title": "Restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI)",
            "description": "China classifies investment as being foreign or domestic. This approach is designed to serve industrial policies by placing conditionality on the opening of markets to foreign investment.\nForeign direct investment (FDI) in China is subject to a complex regulatory regime. One of its key elements is the Catalogue of Industries for Guiding Foreign Investment, the so-called Foreign Investment Catalogue, adopted jointly by NDRC and MOFCOM. The Catalogue classifies investments in all key sectors according to three main categories: encouraged, restricted and prohibited. It should be noted, however, that the Catalogue is not exhaustive neither in terms of listing all existing barriers to foreign investment nor in terms of including all economic sectors.\nSince the Foreign Investment Catalogue was first issued in 1995, it has been one of the most fundamental legal documents regulating foreign investment in China.\nOn 8 October 2016, a nation-wide reform on foreign investment was launched resulting in the removal of the requirement to obtain approval from MOFCOM or its local branches for projects which do not fall within a 'negative list'. (A change from pre-approval to record-filing system).\nDespite announcements made, the State Council failed however to publicize a separate negative list on the same date. Instead, reference continued to be made to the current Foreign Investment Catalogue (2015 Revision).\nUnder the Foreign Investment Catalogue (2015 Revision) and all its previous versions, industries were classified under the following categories: (a) encouraged, (b) restricted and (c) prohibited. The encouraged category covers industries in which foreign investment is provided with the greatest flexibility and where the governmental interference is the lowest. Industries in this sector can also be subject to tax and other investment incentives. This category includes a number of high-tech and advanced manufacturing sectors, such as the for example aerospace or pollution control. The restricted category covers industries in which foreign investment is subject to a higher level of government scrutiny, limitations on the choice of corporate forms (such as mandatory joint ventures) and ownership ceilings. This category includes a number of sub-sectors within the services sector, including banking and insurance. Foreign investment in sectors listed under the prohibited category is simply not permitted at all. This category includes for example the domestic postal service. At the same time, industries which are not expressly listed in the Catalogue are deemed to be permitted.\nDespite its importance, the Catalogue should not be considered the sole reference for foreign investors. Bans, limitations and additional requirements may also result from other mechanisms and laws, such as the National Security Review, the Anti-Monopoly Law or the Joint Venture Law. Other less tangible barriers exist due to cumbersome administrative and licensing procedures as well as local protectionism which can block potential investments altogether. This can be the case also if a given industry is included among the encouraged ones in the Catalogue&mdash;this explains why EU companies continue to feel significant restrictions even though some sectors are nominally opened to foreign investment.\nSince its first promulgation in 1995, the Catalogue was reviewed six times. A new revised version of the Foreign Investment Catalogue was published for comments in December 2016. Though the draft 2017 Revision saw some limited opening of sectors, albeit both narrow and specific, it did not result in any significant improvements for foreign companies. The kinds of limitations to investment that are listed in the Catalogue range from obligations to invest through a joint venture, local content requirements and foreign shareholding requirements, to restrictions on senior managers and members of the board of directors and to limitations to the type of establishment.\nIn the draft 2017 Revision of the Foreign Investment Catalogue, and in order to implement the recent reform on foreign investment, the Draft groups industries under the following two main headings: (a) encouraged and (b) negative list. The negative list section is further divided into three categories:\n\nIndustries under the encouraged category but subject to restrictions on foreign equity holding;\nIndustries under the restricted category; and\nIndustries under the prohibited category.\n\nIf a foreign investor would like to know whether its investment falls within the negative list (and if so, requires MOFCOM approval), it should refer to this negative list.\nSince spring of 2016, NDRC has been piloting in several provinces (nation-wide launch is foreseen for 1 January 2018) a so-called Market Access Negative list. While this list is equally applicable to domestic and foreign investments, it contains another layer of restrictions (thus beyond the Foreign Investment Catalogue) on the investments foreign companies can make in China. Even if the industrial sectors might be the same in Foreign investment Catalogue (FIC) and the domestic Market Access Negative list, the restrictions applicable are not the same. &nbsp;\nMoreover, the Foreign Investment Catalogue is supplemented by a Central and Western China Foreign Investment Catalogue which lists additional encouraged activities and sectors for projects in Central and Western China (China&rsquo;s central and western regions comprise the following provinces and areas: Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia and Xinjiang).\nIn addition to this, the China State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) has released a list of industries where broad investment restrictions will apply and that should remain largely state-owned. For example, the State should solely own, or have a majority share in enterprises engaged in power generation and distribution, oil, petrochemicals and natural gas, telecommunications and armaments.\nMany other laws contain restrictions or conditions on foreign investment including technology transfer requirements.\nForeign companies can invest in China through three vehicles: equity joint ventures (EJV), contractual joint ventures (CJV) and wholly foreign owned enterprise (WFOE). This means that Foreign companies have to take a different legal form than domestic companies which are subject to the China company law, and are subject to different and more stringent conditions, e.g. on the nationality of the CEO or the number of foreign national in the board of directors. We believe that foreign and domestic companies should all be subject to one and single law: the China company law.\nApart from direct restrictions to investment, companies also suffer more indirect barriers due to measures such as targeted enforcement, local discretion or retroactive application of laws as well as unclear or discriminatory licensing procedures. Also, in approval processes, the requirements for foreign investors are often more burdensome, not transparent or known in advance. In 2014, the Commission has commissioned a study on investment restrictions in China (&rsquo;Measures and practices restraining foreign investment in China&rsquo;, 10.08.2014), which is published on DG Trade&rsquo;s website.",

In the run-up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the Government of Japan (GoJ) has set a very ambitious target of welcoming 40 m visitors (up from 24m in 2016). The majority of these visitors will travel through Tokyo&rsquo;s two airports (Narita and Haneda). Haneda, the closest to downtown Tokyo and preferred entry point, is very busy and slot constrained. Very Large Aircraft (VLA) such as the A380 can help the GoJ meet its 40m visitor&rsquo;s target, by improving the utilisation of existing slots, with the deployment of more seats per flight. Moreover, the introduction of new technology to increase aircraft movements is available.\nTo date, the Japanese Civil Aviation Administration (JCAB) has not allowed, despite repeated requests and factual safety demonstrations, access to the Airbus A380 aircraft to Tokyo Haneda airport during daytime.&nbsp;\nJCAB claim that the increased separation necessary for wake-vortex issues at take-off and landing required between the A380 and other aircraft makes it impractical to operate at Haneda because of disruption to traffic flow in this already congested airport.",

After the suspension of this policy by the Prime Minister's Office on 8 July 2013, a new preference policy was adopted for electronic products in Government procurement on 23 December 2013, which eliminates security as a reason for preferences. Furthermore, this new PMA policy is limited to government procurement only, and not extended to private purchases. Local content and value addition requirements for government procurement, however, remain the same. A series of implementation notifications followed. A new preference policy for telecoms is still outstanding (together with implementing guidelines).\nRenewable energy &ndash; solar power plants: the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission laid down local content requirements for solar power plants. The Solar Mission is to be implemented in three phases; the third phase will end in 2022. The first round of selection of projects took place in 2010-2011 based on certain local content requirements (e.g. use of cells and/or modules manufactured in India for solar PV projects). Phase 2 was launched in October 2013 mandating a domestic content requirement: out of the total capacity of 750 MW, 50% (so 375 MW) was kept for bidding with Domestic Content Requirement (DCR). Under DCR, 100% of the solar cells, modules and thin films used in the solar PV power plants must both be made in India. The US challenged this programme at WTO: in August 2015, the panel found that DCR measures were not justified. A notice of appeal has been filed by the Indian government. The DCR is also proving an obstacle to the development of local solar power production because India's manufacturing capacity is low, more expensive than foreign imports and of a lesser quality.",

Presently, such prodcuts can be tested and certified in laboratories globally, or at in-house laboratories of the manufacturers (self-certification).

            "description": "In December 2013, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information (MIIT) issued the Chinese Shipbuilding Scrapping &amp; Newbuilding Subsidy Programme. The scheme is endowed with &euro;19,5 billion RMB (according to SEA Europe) and was originally running until 2015, but was later extended until 2017. There are no official data available on the exact figures and conditions of this scheme.\nThe objective indicated by the Chinese authorities is to phase out obsolete vessels and replace them by more energy efficient ships and, thus, protect the environment/climate and enhance their fleet's safety standards.\nBeneficiaries receive a subsidy of 1500 RMB/GT &ndash; 50% is paid on scrapping the old vessel (1-10 years before their mandatory retirement age), 50% on ordering the new vessel. According to the \"Administration of Central Government Subsidies for the Scrapping of Outdated Ships and Single-hulled Oil Tankers and the Rebuilding of New Ships\" Cai Jian (2014) no 24 the gross tonnage of the newly-built ships should be at least equivalent to that of the disassembled vessels. However, at the EU-China Shipbuilding Dialogue 2014 in Shanghai, MIIT declared that there is no automatic link between scrapping and newbuilding. The vessels must be registered in China and the newbuilding has to take place on a Chinese shipyard. A list of qualified Chinese shipyards entitled to participate was published. The main beneficiaries of the programme are the four state owned shipowners: COSCO, CSG, SINOTRANS-Chang Jing and China Merchant. Foreign equipment manufacturers are apparently allowed to participate subject to complying with certain conditions.\n&nbsp;Conditions for foreign equipment manufacturers:&nbsp;\n\nthe percentage of \"local\" marine equipment must be at least 70%;\n\"local\" supply refers only to manufacturing companies. Sales offices of a foreign marine equipment supplier do not qualify as local suppliers;\nwholly foreign owned manufacturing companies established in China do not qualify as local suppliers either;\nin case of Joint Ventures, the Chinese partner has to be the major shareholder.&nbsp;\n\nThese restrictions have not been written down in any formal document, though. At the EU-China Shipbuilding Dialogue 2014, MIIT declared to have no influence on sourcing maritime equipment. It would be the shipowner's decision. Accordingly, the local content policy is implemented through an arrangement between the shipowner, the shipyard and China Classification Society (CCS) by means of a list of equipment. This not publicly available list attributes a weighting factor to each major component (i.e. 38,5% is attributed to the engines) for calculation of the 70% local content. As a result, a European engine manufacturer can never sell engines to these subsidized ships, regardless of whether they have factories in China or not.\n&nbsp;",

            "description": "Long a hold out amongst advanced economies, Australia has finally committed to join the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), submitting its initial offer in July 2015 and a revised offer in October 2016. This provides an opportunity to seek to address outstanding access issues, particularly at the sub-central level (the Australian States and Territories) where non-discrimination has not been adopted as a key principle, and some discriminatory measures remain in place.\nAt the central (Commonwealth) level, the Australian Government Procurement market is largely non-discriminatory and transparent, governed by the Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPR) which follow a devolved model were Chief Executives of each government entity manage their own procurement within a centrally prescribed framework. This framework is built around the core principle of achieving value for money through competition (i.e. non-discrimination); efficient, effective and ethical procurement; accountability and transparency; consideration of risk; and conducting a process commensurate with the scale and scope of the procurement. Additional requirements exist for procurement above certain thresholds, but a number of \"sensitives\" sectors &ndash; including property and accommodation, motor vehicles, research and development services, defence-related procurement, blood plasma products, business servicing the disabled, and indigenously-owned SMEs - are exempted from these additional requirements (these sectors are also generally exempt from coverage of the procurement chapters in Australia&rsquo;s FTAs). The CPRs also include a target for non-corporate government agencies to source at least 10 per cent of procurement by value from SMEs (defined as an Australian or New Zealand firm with fewer than 200 full-time equivalent employees). Australian officials argue this does not imply any discrimination in favour of SMEs, as the CPRs elsewhere make clear that SMEs will win government business only if they are competitive. In practice, SMEs' share of Commonwealth procurement far exceeds the 10% target (34.4% of total value for 2013-14, 32% for 2012-13, 29% for 2011-12), and therefore the question of discriminating in favour of SMEs to meet the target would not seem to arise.\nIn November 2016 the Australian Finance Minster announced a number changes to the CPRs to come into effect in March next year. In particular, new rules having been introduced requiring tenderers to provide evidence that they have the capability to meet the Australian standard applicable for goods or services being procured, and mandating Commonwealth officials consider the economic benefit of the procurement to the Australian economy (for procurement above A$4&nbsp; million). The Australian Governments asserts that these changes are compliant with the procurement provisions of Australia's FTAs.\nAt the sub-central level, State and Territory governments each have their own policies and legislation governing procurement. While a number of the state government procurement regimes have been moving towards devolved and more transparent and simplified systems similar to arrangements at the federal level, they have not adopted non-discrimination as a key principle, and retain measures aimed at boosting domestic suppliers and local content, particularly SMEs. Sub-central governments may require suppliers to meet a minimum local content in public procurement for \"strategic\" projects (e.g. Victoria) or may impose weighting for local content criterion in tender evaluation (Victoria, South Australia). Western Australia retains a price preference scheme in which it imposes surcharges on goods with a certain proportion of imported content, which works to the advantage of Australian and NZ suppliers. WA Government agencies, when comparing bids, apply a 20% price preference to the portion of a bid that comprises a good, service or items that have been sourced from overseas, excluding New Zealand. However, countries possessing free trade agreements under which state governments are bound by procurement provisions (currently New Zealand, the United States, Chile, Korea and Japan) are excluded from these schemes and requirements.\n&nbsp;",

            "title": "Preference for national goods in public procurement",
            "description": "Public procurement, at least at federal government level, gives preference to goods of domestic origin.&nbsp;The law requires the federal government and its agencies/SOEs and concessionaries of public services etc.,&nbsp;to give preference in their purchases and procurements to buying and leasing goods of domestic origin. Domestic suppliers receive a preference of 7% on their contracts if the bid is made by an SME, or 5% if the bid comes from an enterprise of another kind. Since 2012 all companies with exporting activities, irrespective of their SME status, are also given a preference margin of 7%. In addition, for certain sectors (such as fuel purchasing) it is obligatory to use national suppliers. Different preferences for local suppliers were introduced in the tenders for renewable energy launched by the Ministry of Energy in 2016.\nBackground\nThis trade barrier has been in place in different forms for a long time, except in the period between 1991 and 2001. A \"Buy Argentine\" legislation was applicable until its suspension in 1991. In 2001 the Economic Emergency Law, No. 23.697 reintroduced a preference in favour of domestic industry for the procurement and contracting of goods, works and services by public entities, with a maximum of 10% domestic preference in the case of goods. This provision was subsequently repealed by Law No. 25.551 &ldquo;Compre Trabajo Argentino&rdquo; (Buy Argentine Labour), which established the system of preferences for goods of domestic origin currently applicable.\nThrough Decree 893/2012, adopted on 14 June 2012, a preference margin of 7% was added for suppliers with exporting activities.\nA good is considered as \"domestic\" when it is produced or extracted in Argentina, provided the cost of the imported raw materials, inputs or nationalized materials does not exceed 40% of the gross production value. In the case of procurement for inputs, materials, raw materials or capital goods to be used in the production of goods or the provision of services, domestic preference will be given when, in otherwise similar bids, the prices are equal to or below those of foreign goods. When a bid involving goods of foreign origin is accompanied by a payment or financing plan of some kind, bidders offering goods of domestic origin may request funding from the Bank for Investment and External Trade (BICE) to put them on an equal financial footing.\nIn April 2017 a draft legislative project called ' Buy National \" was submitted by the Argentinian Ministry of Industry to Congress. The project aims at establishing a priority for products of national origin in public procurement with an aim to &nbsp;foster&nbsp; employment and better participation of national suppliers to GP procedures, including SMEs. The project's most problematic provisions are : (1) raising the &nbsp;existing preference in government procurement for SMEs and for other industries: the project foresees that existing margin preference in government procurement would increase &nbsp;from&nbsp; 7% to 12% for small and medium enterprises and from 5% to 8% for other enterprises, and (2) creating incentives to prefer&nbsp; products produced locally. The project foresees that in case of national tendering, it is mandatory for foreign enterprises to&nbsp; enter into transfer of technologies and other cooperation agreements with local enterprises.",

The MoHW earlier committed itself to putting forward the pricing reform methodologies to properly reward innovation, but has yet to suggest any measures which can have a substantial impact on new drug pricing.\nThe industry's difficult situation has been aggravated by the MoHW's implementation (as of January 2014) of the revised Price-Volume Agreement (PVA) of which the scope will be expanded to provide for further cuts in pricing (the claimed amount increases by more than 10% and the annual billing amount increases over 5 billion won).\nIn December 2014 the MoHW made some improvements aiming at facilitating patients' accessibility to new drugs by : i) procedural improvements for new drug listing through the introduction of \"fast-track\"; ii) exemption of pharmaco-economic assessment for pricing of drugs for rare diseases and certain cancer; iii) introduction of refunding system for a limited number of drugs.\nIn July 2016, the MoHW (and the Health Insurance Review Agency) released the revised pricing policy, as part of the results of a Consultation Body initiated by the MOHW since February 2016. The policy included a seemingly&nbsp;discriminatory element against innovative multinational companies i.e. by revising the existing criteria for selecting innovative pharmaceutical companies in a manner to be unfavourable to multinational companies.

            "description": "The South African government has a local procurement target of 75% which it aims to achieve through its Preferential Procurement Regulations.\nThe Preferential Procurement Regulations of 2011 score bids for public tenders on an 90/10 split on price and economic development for contracts above R1 million (modified to 80/20 for contracts below that level), of which local content requirements form part of the 'economic development' criteria and are compulsory.\nThe Regulations also enable the government to designate specific sector and products for local content procurement to a minimum defined threshold. The following sectors and products have been designated thus far to a minimum threshold ranging from 30% to 100%: rail rolling stock, bus bodies, canned/processed vegetables, textile, clothing, leather and footwear sector, solar water heaters, set-top boxes, certain pharmaceuticals products, furniture products, electrical and telecom cables, valves products and actuators, working vessels, residential electricity meters, steel conveyance pipes, powerline hardware and structures and transformers.\nThe following sectors and products are awaiting designation approval: building and construction materials, yellow metals, two way radios, solar PV components and rail signalling system.\nFor non-designated sectors, public entities may still decide to include a specific tendering condition with a minimum threshold for local content as long as there is compliance with the specific directives issued for this purpose by the National Treasury.\nThe Regulations of 2011 are being presently revised and the new draft regulations foresee additional local content requirements in relation sub-contracting with the minimum of 30% to be sub-contracted to certain enterprises and/or categories of enterprises.\nThe Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Programme (REIPPP), which has seen strong participation from the European companies, has stand-alone rules for local procurement. The bids are scored on a 70/30 basis for price and economic development. The minimum threshold for local content reached 45% in the latest round with the target being 60%.\nLocal content requirements also feature strongly in the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) legislation. The new B-BBEE Codes of Good Practice of 2015 have to be complied with for any economic activity with the public institution or entity. The Codes emphasize 'Enterprise and Supplier Development' as one of the five elements of B-BBEE. This element counts for 40 out of the 109 points on the B-BBEE scorecard and has the following three sub-elements: i) preferential procurement; ii) supplier development (existing suppliers); and iii) enterprise development (new entrants). Supplier and enterprise development can only be done for 51% or more black-owned existing businesses.\nPrivate procurement in the key economic sectors might also become subject to local content requirements.

            "description": "The National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications (NRCS) deals with technical regulations and compulsory specifications in South Africa. As part of its process, the NRCS approves products that meet with the requirements of applicable compulsory specifications by issuing Letters of Authority (LOAs) to manufacturers and importers in order that the products can be imported or offered for sale.\nOver the last two years NRCS has come under strong criticism due to critical delays in the emission of LOAs, taking on average between 240-500 days (previously max 120 days). The effects caused by the delays in LOA issuance have had, and continue to have, a negative effect on importers and SA industry alike, affected by staggering demurrage costs and/or losses of sales revenues.\nMoreover, in 2014 South Africa has declared compulsory specifications for energy efficiency and the labelling of electrical and electronic apparatus, adding to the already wide and increasing compulsory specifications specific to each type of electro technical product. The new compulsory certifications, which can only be issued by a South African institution, are burdensome and costly and there appears to be limited capacity among local testing and certification agencies.\nThe NRCS has admitted that it has limited resources to resolve the situation in an expedite manner and has recently presented a detailed set of targets and a performance plan (including a risk based management system) to the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry on 14 September 2016 to resolve the current backlog of LOA. The performance plan included DTI Ministers' instruction that LOAs be issued within 120 calendar days. Shortly after, the CEO of NRCS presented its resignation with no replacement in sight putting into question the implementation of the performance plan.",

This seems to be a violation to the principle of confidentiality of business information (Art. 39.2 TRIPS).\nAs for IPR enforcement:\n\n\nDelays in registration of patents and trademarks, due to cumbersome procedures and weak manpower by IPR authorities;\nWidespread piracy in the sectors of video gaming, music and movie industry;\nWeak IPR enforcement, with insufficient action by relevant authorities to fight IPR infringements;\nBacklogs in Civil Courts for IPR cases due to lack of specialised courts. The government is in the process of creating Commercial Courts for the judgement on, among other, IPR disputes;\nEU stakeholders with standard essential patents face challenges in getting Indian ICT companies, in particular telecom equipment vendors, to pay due royalties;\nLarge number of locally produced infringing goods especially regarding patents and trademarks in the pharmaceutical (7.5% of all detained articles in 2015) and textile (9% over the same period) sectors.\n",

KSA &lsquo;tolerates&rsquo; that tyres sold in KSA also bear the GSO label.\n\n\nThis situation is unnecessarily complex, costly and confusing for industry, consumers suffer the consequences. A &nbsp;common GCC labelling scheme should be put in place. Limitation in time of GSO certificate to a one-year production period should be removed.\n\n&nbsp;\nGCC &ndash; GSO Tyre labelling scheme\nMinimum requirements and labelling of tyres: In implementation since Jan 2016\nNo legal text was ever published.&nbsp;Manufacturers are informed by GSO as things are decided/they find out whilst trying to access the market.\nBoth label and procedure to obtain it are becoming increasingly similar to the Saudi one.\nManufacturers are adapting their procedures accordingly, but the supply of the market has suffered some disruption.\nThe labelling process as well as the label are still being updated!\n&nbsp;\nSaudi (SASO - Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality Organization) tyre labelling scheme\nIn implementation since November 2015.&nbsp;Legal text still changing.\nGood cooperation with the EU through the TBT channel, but messy process (many different legal texts circulating at the same time).\nImplementation also complicated and with delays.\nPeculiar system whereby KSA is member of GSO and yet GSO labelling is not compulsory, KSA has its own labelling system.\n-----\nDifferent texts concerning minimum requirements for tyres and tyre labelling&nbsp;were notified to the TBT Committee under WTO notification numbers G/TBT/N/SAU/835&nbsp;and&nbsp;G/TBT/WTO/N/SAU/907 on 16 July 2015 and 5 January 2016. In addition the \"Regulation for procedures of data registration and issuance of the energy efficiency labels in vehicles and tyres\" was shared with Industry but not notified.\nThe GSO is implementing its own tyre labelling and minimum requirement system. As Saudi Arabia is part of GCC and a member of GSO, tyre manufacturers exporting to Saudi Arabia fear they have&nbsp;to comply with&nbsp;double mandatory labelling systems. In practice, Saudi Arabia does not require the GCC marking but tolerates it\nWith regard to tyre minimum requirements and labelling systems, Industry&nbsp;has had the following concerns (most of them currently solved):\n1). Snow tyres - the exemption for and definition of snow tyres was deleted.\n2). Complementary references (Article 2) -All dates of REgulations have been deleted inthe latest versionof the text.\n3). Definitions (Article 3)&nbsp;- C.1 tyres: The reference to N1 tyres should be reinstated. Tyre Type: The load designationshould be takenout of the definition of tyre type.4) Wet grip limits (Art 5 para 5.1.2 and&nbsp;table 2) - Industry would like a special allowance fr C2 Traction and Secial Use tyres.\n5) Table 4a and&nbsp;4b mentioned&nbsp;in para 5.2 - These are missing.\n6).

Bar code and font of label size - Industry&nbsp;would like clarification on the correct label format.&nbsp;\nIndustry&nbsp;also indicated that:\n1). The final text of the Regulation was published in July 2015 and implemented from 1 November 2015 but subsequently modified again in January 2016 which led to significant logistical problems for Industry.\n2). They would like C2 threshold implementation timings to be aligned with C3.\n3).

            "description": "The Venezuelan Government has maintained a system of currency controls since February 2003 with dual or multiple fixed and/or adjustable official exchange rates structure. Under this system, currency restrictions are applicable to all transactions in foreign currency, which includes exports and imports of goods and services and financial and capital transactions.&nbsp;\nAs a feature of the complex exchange arrangements, there are controls for current account transactions, payments for invisible and current transfers transactions, repatriation proceeds from exports and foreign direct investments (capital and dividends), for capital market securities, money market, collective investment securities and derivatives, commercial and financial credits, guarantees, financial backup facilities, personal capital transactions and specific provisions to commercial banks and other credit institutions and for institutional investors.&nbsp;\nThe system has in place two official mechanisms, the Protected Exchange Rate (DIPRO)&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Complementary Exchange System (DICOM) from March 2016, and DICOM updated on May 2017 (Forex Regulation N&ordm; 38) to provide companies and individual&rsquo;s access to foreign currency. As previous mechanisms, each one has a different exchange rate for foreign currencies, mainly the US dollar (USD) per bolivars (VEF), depending on the priority of the products and the purpose of the transaction. DIPRO is a primary exchange rate of VEF/USD 10 that applies only to essential imports, such as medicines and food, as well raw materials for production, pensions for Venezuelans living abroad, and national students at academic institutions abroad. This market covers 93% of the exchange operations on daily basis and it is administrated by Foreign Trade Centre (CENCOEX). In contrast, DICOM feeds only 7% residual of the exchange market and it is administrated by Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) with a controlled floating exchange rate that applies for all non-essential imports.&nbsp;\nThe procedure for obtaining foreign currency under DIPRO continues to be very burdensome. Due the officially available foreign currency is far less than the demand a considerable number of companies have arrears with their suppliers abroad and therefore are lacking inputs for their production.&nbsp;\nAlso foreign investors in Venezuela are facing problems to convert their local earnings into USD or EUR. Venezuela have had six different exchange systems, some of them superposed, under the Foreign Exchange Control still in force during its 14 years of operation (CADIVI, SITME, SICAD I, SICAD II, SIMADI and from March 09, 2016 DIPRO-DICOM) which limits seriously the investor access to the very restricted foreign currency markets and with complex barriers for investors to handle.&nbsp;\nThe current regime, the Complementary Exchange System (DICOM) that works with a floating rate, was updated in May 2017 to operate through 8 currency auctions a month. The offer of each auction has been around USD 25M, adapted to the low liquidity of the Central Bank. The price of bidding was set, initially, in a fixed range between 1,800 to 2,200 VEF/USD, but it was rapidly increased to 2,010-2,640 (16 June 2017). Further adjustments to devaluation pressures might be expected for the near future.",

            "description": "Zeroing is a calculation device used by the United States for increasing, often substantially, the exporter&rsquo;s margin of dumping and thus the amount of anti-dumping duty paid. Zeroing has two main effects on EU exporters. Firstly, it increases the amount of duty paid on those goods exported to the US, thus reducing their competitiveness. Secondly, by increasing the rate of anti-dumping duty, it deters many exporters from exporting to the US at all. The US system: Following a new investigation, the US imposes an anti-dumping duty per exporter and, upon request, revises the level of the duty every year in a so-called &rsquo;administrative review&rsquo;. Such reviews involve a new calculation of dumping on the imports which enter the US during the previous year. For example, if an anti-dumping duty is imposed on 1 January 2008, the first review will begin in January 2009, covering imports into the US during the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2008. In most cases, it is these reviews which determine how much anti-dumping duty is actually collected, as the duty rate from the original investigation is replaced by the rate found in the first administrative review. In these circumstances, the only relevance of the dumping margin in the original investigation is to determine whether it is above the minimum threshold of 2% which enables the US to impose a duty in the first place.It is important to note that in reviews, the US can either increase or decrease the level of anti-dumping duty. This contrasts with the EC system, in which anti-dumping duties can only be refunded to importers if the dumping margin goes down, not increased if it goes up. In addition, while the EC compares average prices in such cases, the US uses zeroing (i.e. it disregards the non-dumped transactions). Hence, zeroing in reviews in the US system (with its ability to increase the duty rate) can be said to give the US a &rsquo;structural advantage&rsquo; over the EC and other WTO Members.",

Normally, products in free circulation in the EU with a A.TR. certificate should have direct access to the Turkish market except where checks are justified on the basis of a risk analysis. However, EU companies have experienced problems when importing into Turkey. The common denominator is that Turkish authorities are demanding to see test reports for products, even though there haven't been any incidents of malfunctions or defects with the products. This problem mainly affects products like pumps, electric linear actuator systems, designer objects for household use, thermos.\nIn addition, increased TAREKS inspections on phthalates in footwear have been reported since 10 August 2014. Results from accredited EU laboratories are not accepted. The failing rate for FTA&nbsp;partners is of 0,3%",

            "description": "Turkey requires for imports of old, second hand, renovated goods an import license. This limitation derives from article 7 of the Turkish Import Code (Council of Ministers n&deg;1995/7606 published in December 1995). On the basis of this article 7, the Undersecretariat for Foreign Trade (UFT) issues a new communiqu&eacute; every year as part of the Turkish Import Regime to list products which might be exempted from the import licensing and under which conditions. The Communiqu&eacute;s contain three different annexes (lists) corresponding to three import regimes:\n&bull; The list 1/A includes products that can be imported without any license. This list mainly covers a limited number of machinery which can be directly used by the Turkish manufacturing industry.\n&bull; The list 1/B requires listed products to obtain a \"letter of clearance\" from the Turkish institutions indicated in the list itself.\n&bull; The list 2 covers also mainly machinery products which can only be imported freely if the declared value is higher than a minimum (CIF) price (indicated in the Communiqu&eacute;).\nThe last Communiqu&eacute; 2014/9, adopted in December 2013, includes the three different import regimes mentioned above and adds 36 products to the list 1/A (fully liberalised products). 30 of these products were in the List 2 (goods liberalised only if above a minimum price) of the Communiqu&eacute; 2013/9. This is a positive development. However, the list of fully liberalised products in the Communiqu&eacute; 2014/9 does not include the products identified by the Commission's letter to the Turkish authorities of 14 March 2011. These products were only partially liberalised in 2012 (if above a minimum price). In addition, one of these products &ndash; the retreaded tyres &ndash; was not included in any of the liberalisation lists and the current import regime for these products is similar to de facto import ban. The reasons put forward by Turkey with regard to the import ban are based on environmental considerations (increase of waste accumulation because of their life cycle). However, retreaded tyres are type-approved under UNECE Regulations 108/109, and therefore legally accepted for commercialisation under same conditions (including guarantee) as new ones. Turkey is a signatory of those UNECE Regulations, and furthermore allows retreaded tyres on its market, but continues to ban the EU exports",

            "description": "1) Ad-valorem taxation on spirits was fully eliminated by a Turkish government decree adopted on 6 April 2009 and new specific duty rates, in line with the EU acquis, were introduced. However, these rates discriminated in favour of domestically produced raki and against types of spirits primarily imported from the EU (e.g. whisky and rum). Then, in the framework of the negotiations to open chapter 16 &ndash; Taxation, Turkey adopted an Action Plan on 18 May 2009, setting clear milestones with a view to the full gradual elimination of discriminatory taxation on spirituous beverages and imported tobacco. Since then, Turkey has introduced successive across the board excise tax increases, where the same percentage increase was applied to each category of spirits. This was not in accordance with the Turkish Action Plan. This barrier was qualified as \"key\" barrier during the update of the key barriers list in February 2014.\n2) Turkey previously required two certificates for importation from the EU &ndash; the Certificate of Conformity for Importation (CCI) required by the Tobacco Board and the Control Certificate (CC) required by the Ministry of Agriculture. However, the CCI requirement was abolished in 2008 and the brand-specific import permit - the Control Certificate - at the end of 2011. Currently we monitor the pre-notification regime which is now in place. This barrier is not a key barrier.\n3) In September 2013, Turkey introduced a new product verification and tracking label for food stuffs, including alcoholic beverages, without properly notifying this, either under the TRIS or under the WTO TBT Agreement. We were informed that Turkey has revised its legislation so that alcoholic beverages will no longer be included.\n4) We are informed that the Turkish customs authorities are carrying out excessive sampling controls whereby, generally, at least 2 bottles are removed for analysis, on each depletion of stock from bonded warehouses. Turkey has put in place an inspection regime and if companies apply for and submit to an authorisation check, the level of sampling can be reduced from 100% to 10%. Since the EU has stringent controls on safety standards for alcoholic beverages and we have a Customs Union with free movement of goods, such sampling controls in Turkey should not be necessary. This barrier was qualified as \"key\" barrier during the update of the key barriers list in February 2014.\n5). Legislation on warning messages placed on containers of alcoholic beverages and procedures and principles concerning domestic and foreign trading of alcoholic beverages.In mid-2013, the Turkish government enacted legislation imposing a range of restrictions, including: (a) a ban on advertising and promotion of alcoholic beverages and to restrict on- and off-trade premises close to places of worship or education; and (b) to require all alcoholic beverages to carry health warnings.The legislation requires all alcoholic beverages to show 3 logos, targeted at minors, pregnant women and drivers, with an additional message which translates as &lsquo;alcohol is not your friend&rsquo;.In addition, EU brewers that normally use a uniform mark for their entire product range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, may not be able to sell their alcohol-free beer in Turkey, if the variant containing alcohol is already on the Turkish market and vice-versa.This barrier is not a key barrier.\n6). The appointment of a new operating company for the product-tracking system under the Ministry of Finance and the possible introduction of a new strip stamp system for alcoholic beverages in Turkey has been pending for more than a year. With regard to beer, the unit price for coded labels for imported bottled or canned beers, applied in foreign production facilities (including bonded warehouses and free zones) by the importers&rsquo; own capabilities is higher than the equivalent unit price for locally produced bottled or canned beers applied on serial production lines by the producers themselves in their own facilities. Turkey has indicated that the discrimination was removed.&nbsp;This barrier was qualified as \"key\" barrier during the update of the key barriers list in February 2014.",

            "title": "Restrictive trade-related requirements",
            "description": "Description \nSince 2009 Argentina imposed on importers certain trade-restrictive requirements (TRRs) as a condition to import goods into Argentina, including, inter alia, to limit their imports, to balance them with exports, to make or increase their investments in production facilities in Argentina, to increase the local content of the products they manufacture in Argentina, not to transfer benefits abroad and/or to control prices by freezing or reducing prices of products sold domestically. Argentinean authorities requested import plans for the following year regarding imports and controlled compliance with the above-mentioned commitments. These commitments could be unilateral commitments or signed agreements with the government.\nMoreover, Argentina set up an import-licensing procedure known as the Advanced Sworn Import Declaration (Declaraci&oacute;n Jurada Anticipada de Importaci&oacute;n, or DJAI). This procedure required firms to secure approval by the Argentinean authorities before importing goods.\nThe EU, the US and Japan launched WTO dispute settlement procedure against these TRRs and against the DJAI import licensing procedure. In January 2015 the WTO Dispute Settlement Body found them incompatible with WTO rules.\nArgentina claimed that it has fully complied with the recommendations and rulings of the DSB. In particular, Argentina claimed that it has ceased to apply the TRRs measure; that the legislation establishing the DJIA measure was repealed; and that it has adopted resolutions establishing new import monitoring (Sistema Integral de Monitoreo de Importaciones, SIMI) and licensing (automatic and non-automatic) systems. The new import licensing system contemplates automatic licenses for all final products and non-automatic licenses for around 1500 tariff lines. See barrier No 12700. \n&nbsp;Background\nWith the introduction in 2012 of the system of Prior Sworn Import Declarations (\"Declaraci&oacute;n Jurada Anticipada de Importaci&oacute;n\" &ndash; DJAI), trade related requirements became part of the approval process. Often the Argentinean authorities made the approval of DJIAs conditional upon the importers undertaking to comply with trade restrictive commitments.\nThese trade-related requirements were part of WTO dispute settlement cases DS438/444/445 Argentina - Measures Affecting the Importation of Goods. The WTO rulings represented a full victory for the EU, Japan and the US. The WTO panel findings of 2014 of WTO-inconsistency were confirmed by the WTO Appellate Body report of January 2015.\nIn particular, the Appellate Body (AB) confirmed the Panel&rsquo;s findings that Argentina&rsquo;s imposition of trade-related requirements operates as a single measure which constitutes a restriction on the importation of goods inconsistent with Article XI:1 and Article III:4 of the GATT 1994. The AB also confirmed that the DJAI import licensing procedure constitutes a restriction on the importation of goods, inconsistent with Article XI:1 of the GATT 1994.\nThe AB report can be found here:\nhttp://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news15_e/438_444_445abr_e.htm",

Although this note is yet to be formally withdrawn, no complaints have been registered since the change of government in late 2015.\nBackground\nSince 7 May 2010 and following Internal Note n&ordm; 232 sent from the former Secretary of State for Internal Trade (currently Secretariat for Trade) to INAL (Instituto Nacional de Alimentos), INAL reportedly started to delay the issuance of \"certificates of free circulation\" for food imports. The issuance of these certificates, which are necessary for releasing products in the domestic market, had used to be a formality in the past. As a consequence of the mentioned note, INAL started sending all demands for a certificate to the Secretary of State for Internal Trade and had to wait for its approval. According to the information gathered by the EU Delegation in its meeting with INAL on 3 June 2010, it would be only after this approval that INAL would issues its own certificate.\nThis practice produced negative effects on EU exports, such as blocked containers, no new orders from importers, etc. Several EU products were affected including canned peaches, cheese, premium food products, pasta, oil, etc. For instance in 2010 Spanish olive oil, olives, some meat products and turr&oacute;n were blocked for several months. Canned peaches exports from Greece, as well as exports of cheese, pasta and gourmet food also fell to zero during these years.",

These allegations remain to be confirmed.\nSince December 2015, under the new administration, the Ministry of Communication responsible for managing the satellite sector is applying an \"open sky\" policy and many new authorisations to provide satellite services are being granted, however, always under the reciprocity condition.

            "description": "Argentina has in place a legal framework in line with TRIPS including a sui generis protection by means of a national register that in principle is also available to foreign Geographic Indications (GI) holders but procedures are very lengthy and burdensome. So far no EU GI has been registered. One of the major difficulties is that GI denominations considered as &ldquo;generic&rdquo; names cannot be registered and many European GIs are considered in Argentina as &ldquo;generic&rdquo; and mentioned as such in the local food codex &ldquo;Codigo Alimentario&rdquo;. There are concerns on misappropriation of many European GI names.\nGI protection for wines and spirits is in place since January 2004 (when Law No 25.163 of 1999 entered into force) and for agricultural and food products since May 2009 (when law No 25.380 of 2001 entered into force).\nDespite the registration procedures being open to foreign right holders, so far no EU GI has been registered. And without registration, EU GI holders lack legal means to defend their rights in Argentina.\nAt the same time the existing Mercosur rules (MERCOSUR/GMC/Resoluci&oacute;n N&deg;26/03 - transposing TRIPS requirements) and implemented in Argentina by Resolution 146/2004 on labelling of packaged foods, establishes that the geographical appellations of a country, a region or a population, recognised as places, in which are manufactured foods with specific characteristics, cannot be used for labelling or advertisement of foods manufactured in other places when this can mislead the customer. It prohibits the use of the expression \"type\" to names associated with wines and spirits (TRIPS requirement) but allows it for agricultural products and foodstuffs. This latter increases the risk that those names become \"generic\".\nIn addition, there is widespread misappropriation of European GI names notably in the wine and spirit sector (for instance private operators try to obtain registration of European GI names, logos or official mentions as trademarks). The settlement of such cases through INPI (Instituto Nacional de la Propiedad Intelectual) takes much time.",

Under this provisional measure, the Government was entitled to move from an ad valorem duty to a specific duty per kg for eleven chapters. Against all expectations, this provisional measure turned into the Law 11.727, which was finally approved in June 2008, with a broader scope as it does not specify any specific chapter or unit, meaning that any ad valorem tariff line could be replaced by a specific duty of around 5,4 &euro; per unit.",

Furthermore a progressive export tax scheme from 20-25% in 2014 to 60% in 2016 on 65 mineral categories was introduced. On 11 January 2017, the Indonesian government issued Government Regulation No 1/2017 which allowed companies to continue exporting unprocessed and semi-processed mineral ores, previously subject to full ban starting from 12 January 2017. However, the relaxation requires companies to convert their Contract of Work (KK) into Special Mining Business License (with less investment protection) and to be committed to build smelters within five years. Companies that are remained active under the Contracts of Work can only be allowed to export processed minerals. Foreign miners must also gradually divest their shares up to 51% to local entity after 10 years of production in order to extend their export permits.&nbsp;Indonesia is a key global supplier of important metals such as nickel, copper and bauxite. While the EU imports from Indonesia were limited, indirect economic effects on the EU are likely to result from the impact of the restrictions on globally traded raw materials. In addition the EU is concerned by the systemic effect of a ban on export, one of the most extreme and damaging restrictions, setting a very damaging precedent in a time of resource nationalism.\nc) Trade Law (7/2014) confers powers to the Government to introduce export restrictions if justified on national interests.",

            "description": "Over the last decade, the distribution market in Vietnam has turned from a rather simple and rudimentary market to a key economic sector with a contribution of aproximately 15% to GDP. This achievement greatly resulted from the accession of Vietnam to WTO in 2007 which pushed the growth to four times higher than in 2006.The Vietnamese distribution market has caught up very fast with other markets in the world. Before 1993, there were only open-air market in the country, only 14 years later Vietnam ranked 4th (after India, Russia and China) out of 30 world&rsquo;s most attractive retail markets released by AT Kearney, an international management consulting firm.\nOn 1st January 2009, Vietnam opened its distribution market to 100% foreign ownership as part of its WTO commitments. However, an economic needs test (ENT) is compulsory for any retail outlet to be established beyond the first one. In this respect, it appears that there is no nation-wide implementing legislation to clarify the ENT criteria, which results in discretionary interpretation by different local authorities of the criteria contained in the WTO GATS schedule. The lack of implementing rules, in particular clarification of ENTs, creates legal uncertainty for EU companies.\nRules for ENT were relaxed in case of establishing an outlet less than 500m2 - within the area planned for trading activities and already completed construction of infrastructure, ENT is not required. Circular No. 08/2013/TT-BCT provides for rules governing ENTs and sets the exemption from ENT for outlets of less than 500m2.",

            "description": "Despite recent domestic efforts to curb intellectual property (IP) infringements, the situation remains problematic for EU companies operating in this country. There are deficiencies in IPR enforcement, namely in the fight against physical and online piracy and counterfeiting, as well as a considerable registration backlog in patent and trademark applications. The delay in the ratification of the Madrid Protocol further contributes to this backlog. Particular difficulties exist in the registration of pharmaceutical patents due to additional discriminatory requirements. As regards protection of geographical indications, some limitations are causing concern.\nSee also case \"10061 - Pharmaceutical\".\n&nbsp;\nBackground\nAlthough there are improvements in IPR protection and enforcement, problems of counterfeiting and digital piracy remain of concern. There is embryonic collaboration on customs at a national level which should help in the future. INPI (the national IP office) has undergone restructuring and has recruited 210 extra staff in 2016-2017 which should help in decreasing the current trademark and patent backlogs by 2020 (INPI's estimate). The recently launched online application system for trademarks should help speed up the registration process.&nbsp;However, the Ministry of Health (ANVISA) has a power of veto (for public health reasons) on pharmaceutical patent applications (set out in Joint Order (Portaria Conjunta No.1)&nbsp;of 12 April 2017 on the working arrangements between ANVISA and INPI). ANVISA should not, however, interfere with the patent examination per se based on patentability criteria set out in international law. The Brazilian court system is slow and sanctions are not deterrent enough to combat IP infringements.\nWith regard to geographical indications, Brazilian law does not consider the registration of names that are not strictly geographical names. This narrow interpretation runs contrary to the provisions of TRIPS Article 22.1, which refers to geographical \"indications\".&nbsp;A law has been drafted to bring the definition of geographical indications into line with TRIPS but it has not yet been discussed by the new government (of 2016). The new law would allow for the registration of EU geographical indications such as \"Feta\" and \"Scotch Whisky\" which have been blocked for some years in Brazil. In Brazil, \"Cacha&ccedil;a\", not being a geographic place name, has been protected by a Presidential Decree since 2001 (Decreto n&ordm; 4.062 (Cacha&ccedil;a do Brasil), 21/12/2001).",

The Swiss government itself warned the Parliament that the reclassification constitutes an infringement of Swiss international committments (WTO commitments, bilateral agricultural agreement with the EU). The reclassification of seasoned meat will result in significantly higher import tariffs for seasoned meat compared to current ones. The amendment entered into force on 1st July 2016.\nIn the meantime, a decision has been taken to reduce the tariff for seasoned meat (in chapter 2 since 01/07/2016) \"imported for the purpose of producing dry meat\" to CHF 6,38/kg (tariff applicable to imports of products under chapter 16). . Importers will have to prove upon request by the customs authorities that the meat has been imported for that purpose.

The amended part of the commuiniqu&eacute; 90 designates and differentiates the customs offices authorized to clear furniture with EU and non-EU origin. The impossibility for non-EU origin furniture to be cleared by the customs administration from where the goods enter the country will imply increase of the transport costs (because of the additional distance), increase in terms of traffic and negative environmental effects. To designate specific customs offices for declaring specific goods as such is not against customs rules and it happens also in the EU MS. However, this practice has to be justified (special type of goods, special expertise required for clearance etc). In addition to this justification, there can not be a discrimination between the goods of EU and non-EU origine. The amended communiqu&eacute; 90 and the differentiation between the EU and non -EU origine furnitures is questionnable under the article 3 paragraph 1 (goods in free circulation in the EU and Turkey) and article 4 (elimination of customs duties and charges having equivalent effect) of the Decision 1/95.",

The importers have to apply for a franchise document at the \"direction du commerce de wilaya\". This franchise document is considered by the Algerian authorities as statistical licence allowing a follow-up of imports. However, in reality this document represents an additional formality, not provided for in the EU - Algeria Association Agreement (AA) and its Protocol 6. According to the AA the granting of preferences for EU products when imported in Algeria is subject only to a proof of origin &ndash; movement certificate EUR.1 or invoice declaration. The EU has offered several times its technical assistance to the Algerian authorities in order to put in place a less burdensome and compatible with the AA mechanism for follow-up of imports.\nThe EU welcomes the positive development observed since the adoption of the circular 64/MC/DGCE/DSPEC/15 on 13 January 2015. The Algerian authorities have stopped the practice according to which the EUR.1 certificate was requested by the trade authorities for the issuance of the franchise document. This allows reducing the time necessary for the issuance of the franchise and limiting the logistic expenses. However, the requirement of franchise document remains an additional and unnecessary administrative burden for imports which is in breach of the AA.",

A wide range of products are affected by this measure (entered into force in February 2001), such as: bovine meat, bovine products ovine products and even cosmetics made of cattle and sheep tissue.\nSuch a ban is not in line with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) standards, which provide for safe trade conditions. These conditions are strictly respected by the EU and therefore the EU guarantees safe bovine and bovine products, not only for EU consumers but also for the exported bovine and bovine products. Indeed, the EU has comprehensive measures in place aimed at assuring the highest level of consumer protection, in form of a strict feed ban and strict controls on Specific Risk Materials (SRM) and active surveillance. These measures have also been recognised by the OIE, EU Member States being categorised by the OIE either as having a \"controlled risk\" or \"negligible risk\". Despite EU's stringent controls and measures for BSE in line with OIE standards, EU beef and other bovine products are still banned by Taiwan. By keeping this import ban in place on EU bovine and bovine products, Taiwan is considered not following its commitments under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement on the application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS).\nMoreover, Taiwan, by accepting meat from trading countries than EU with a similar OIE BSE risk categorisation status, acts in a discriminatory way.\nThe European Commission continues to work closely together with Taiwan to find a rapid solution on the lifting of these unjustified trade restrictions imposed on the EU.",

The EU took immediate measures to restrict movements out of the well-defined infect areas and informed, in detail, trading partners on the stringent measures put in place which guarantee that safe trade can continue to take place. The EU measures have proven to be effective. However, despite that Taiwan has received all necessary, detailed information that safe trade can continue, the Competent Authority of Taiwan continues to maintain its more-than-necessary trade-restrictive measures on the whole country of Poland with a total block of imports of pigs and pig products into Taiwan.\nThe EU considers such country-wide bans unjustified and disproportionate as stringent measures have been put in place with well-defined infected areas (regionalisation/zoning measures) which are fully in line with the relevant international standards as laid down by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Therefore, Taiwan's overly trade restrictive measures, which do not recognise EU's regionalisation measures, are considered not in line with the WTO SPS Agreement nor with the international standards of the OIE which advocate for the least trade disruptive measures, which means in this case to only put trade restrictive measures in place on the well-defined and controlled affected zones and not on a whole country.

            "description": "In the framework of the Customs Union between EU and Turkey, duty-free tariff quotas for processed agricultural products have been established and set out in the EC-Turkey Association Council Decision 1/2007. The duty-free tariff quotas cover a list of processed agricultural products on both sides, among others, chocolates, bakery products, pasta and sugar confectionery. The&nbsp;Mininstry of Economy (MoE)&nbsp;is the competent authority in charge of the management of the tariff quota system in Turkey. For the allocation of quotas the principle used in the EU and set in the Turkish legislation is that of &rsquo;first come-first served&rsquo;. However, when implementing the quotas for certain products, the Turkish authorities continue to impose a series of specific requirements inter alia: a maximum of 10 tons per application per single customs code, a possibility of further application only after completion of the previous one, applicants should be producers based in Turkey etc. This management of tariff quota allocations by Turkey does not allow EU exporters to benefit from the duty free quotas in a transparent manner and without additional administrative burden. As part of its obligation under the CU Turkey should align its quota management rules with the EU ones, and hence apply the first-come-first-served principle without additional requirements.\nWith regard to the requirement for importers to be also producers in order to have the right to apply for tariff quotas, it should be noted that there has been some progress and currently the restriction of being a domestic producer applies only to the products covered by the following tariff lines 1704.10-chewing gum, 1704.90 &ndash; other sugar confectionery (excluding 1704.90.10) and 18.06 &ndash; chocolate and other food containing cocoa (excluding 1806.10.15).",

            "description": "Lack of alignment with OECD practices in respect of transfer pricing, business profit and intra-group tax rules together with complex domestic taxation systems which include multiple cascading and discriminatory taxes that pose numerous challenges to EU companies operating in Brazil.\n&nbsp;\nBackground\nAlthough the Federal Government presented a proposal for a tax reform in the year 2009 with the objective of simplifying the indirect tax system and reducing the tax burden, given the numerous problems triggered by the complexity of the previous system, not much has been achieved so far. The only modifications were limited to replacing corporate social security charge by a lower charge applied to corporate revenues. Furthermore it was announced that the value added tax applied to imported goods at the interstate level will be harmonized nationally and reduced down to 4% from the current 7-12% range depending on the State of destination. Nevertheless, as the Government itself assumes, more comprehensive reforms are still needed in order to streamline Brazil&acute;s complex tax system. Although the reform is claimed to be a priority of the new administration after the election of 2014, no specific projects were made public so far. The only modifications aimed at an \"adjustment\" between taxable basis of certain contributions for domestic and nationally produced goods (PIS/COFINS) that consisted of an introduction of differential tax rates which added to the complexity and ambiguity of the system. Additional main concerns for EU operators pertain, in particular, the lack of alignment with OECD practices when calculating the transfer pricing, the CIDE tax, levied on the transfer of any kind of \"technology\", the high tax rates applied to imported perfumes, the increase of PIS/COFINS levied on imports and the Reintegra programme for tax reimbursements of exports.\nThe main concerns of EU companies are:\n&bull; Lack of alignment with OECD practises regarding of transfer pricing, business profit and intra-group tax rules - The Brazilian Act 9959 of 27 January 2000 establishes a specific \"PRL-method\" (Metodo do Pre&ccedil;o de revenda menos Lucro) whereby transfer pricing is defined as the average resale price of the final product minus several kind of taxes, commissions and discounts on sales and a potential profit margin of 60%. This calculation method may differ from the result of the arm&rsquo;s length principle, which is advocated by the OECD rules where transfer pricing of intra-group transactions must be the same as if the parties were not related. The method applied may lead to a tax distortion, when calculating tax revenues of the host countries, and lead to double taxation issues.\n&bull; Problems related to taxation of \"technological knowledge\" transfer due to the discriminatory nature of the CIDE tax (tax on the contribution for intervention in the economic domain), which was established by Law 10168/2000 and further complemented by Law 10332/2001. CIDE is collected to provide financial support to priority scientific and technological development programs and projects. CIDE is levied on payments made by Brazilian companies to foreign suppliers which provide inter alia some kind of \"technological knowledge\" such as patent assignments, trademarks or technical assistance services. Since 2006, CIDE no longer applies to software, except when it involves transfer of the corresponding technology (Articles 20 and 21 of Law 11452/2007). CIDE amounts to 10% of the underlying transaction. However, the retroactive effect of the law with regard to software only goes back to 1 January 2006. By contrast, Brazilian companies are not subject to CIDE when they pay for the acquisition or use of domestically produced \"technology\".\n&bull; Taxation of perfumes versus \"eau de toilette\" &ndash; Due to the lack of fiscal or custom legislation that precisely defines perfume and \"eau de toilette\", Brazilian fiscal administration uses Decree 79094/77, which was complemented by a sanitary regulation, making&nbsp;the distinction between these two products on the basis of their respective concentration of aromas. As a result of this distinction, Brazilian importers (ADIPEC - Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o dos Distribuidores e Importadores de Perfumes e Cosm&eacute;ticos) confirmed that most Brazilian domestic products are classified as &rsquo;eau de toilette&rsquo; and taxed at an IPI (Tax on Industrial Products) rate of 12%, while most of imports from the EU are considered to be perfumes and taxed at 42%. The issue was also dealt with at EU-Brazil Joint Committee meetings. No progress was reported, and despite Brazil&acute;s confirmation on on-going revision of the Decree 79094/77, no modifications took place so far. However, according to the Ministry of Finance the sanitary regulation in question seems not to be a valid legal basis for making this distinction.\n&bull; Introduction of an increased rate of PIS/COFINS for imports - PIS and COFINS increases for imported goods were officially introduced by the Provisional Measure (MP) 668/15 adopted and published on 30 January 2015. The combined PIS/COFINS rate for imports was increased generally by 2.5 percent (from 9.25 percent to 11.75 percent) with a higher increase for certain specific categories of products (pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, tyres etc.). The increased contributions applied as of 1 May 2015 (90 days after the publication as per the constitutional requirement). The MP 690/2015 was adopted by the Congress and published as Law 13.137/2015 of 19 June 2015. In addition to a higher tax rate for specific products, the measure also introduces restrictions in the use of tax credits that operate only for imports of these specific products and as a result importers can only deduct from their PIS/COFINS liabilities the amount of the standard rate. This results in an increase of the effective tax paid by importers, who cannot offset against future liabilities the full amount of the tax paid, contrary to local producers.Furthermore some imported products are subjected to a supplementary 1% PIS/COFINS tax, also without the possibility of earning a tax credit.The tax hikes and credit restrictions affect only imported goods, which thereby are placed at a competitive disadvantage in the Brazilian market. According to the Brazilian Government, the rationale for the tax increase relates to a need to compensate for the difference between the taxable bases for imported products (that following the Supreme Federal Tribunal &ndash;STF &ndash; Ruling 55937/2013 must be the customs value, without adding any other taxes or charges) and for domestic companies (where other domestically paid fiscal burdens are apparently included i.e. ICMS).\n&bull; Reintegra - Law No. 12,546 of 14 December 2011 introduced the Special Regime for the Reimbursement of Taxes for Exporters, known as Reintegra. The programme enables exporters of manufactured goods to recover residual indirect tax costs levied on the production chain, such as the Tax on Services (ISS), the financial transaction tax (IOF), and the royalty tax (CIDE). Under the current rules the exporter does not have to provide any calculation proving that the sums reimbursed corresponds to internal taxes imposed on the exported products. BR thus does not have a system in place that ensures that the reimbursed amount does not exceed the amount of indirect taxes paid.&nbsp;Companies that export goods manufactured in Brazil are entitled to a refund of their gross receipts from exports, to be used either as a credit against federal tax liabilities, or as a cash payment. Manufactured goods must: (i) be included in the Industrialized Products Tax Table (Tabela de Incid&ecirc;ncia do Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados &ndash; TIPI) and listed in an act issued by the Executive branch; and (ii) the cost of the imported content of the goods must not exceed a percentage of their export price. Decree No. 7.633 of 1 December 2011 provides a list of eligible goods and sets the maximum value of imported content at 40% for most products, except in the case of high-tech goods (e.g. pharmaceuticals, electronics, and aircraft and parts), which may have up to 65% of imported&nbsp; inputs.&nbsp;Imported goods do not benefit from the programme. Reintegra benefits were applied to exports made until 31 December 2012 with a reimbursement rate of 3%. %. It was then reinserted in 2014 with law 13.043/2014.Originally with reimbursement rates of 1% for 2015 and 2016 and then 2% in 2017 and 3% in 2018. By decree 8.543 of 2015 the percentage of reimbursement was lowered to 0.1% from December 2015 to December 2016 (and then continues under the original schedule).&nbsp;\n&nbsp;",

            "description": "Implementation of the 8 Days Pre-announcement Rule for Workers\nEU businesses posting temporarily workers in Switzerland for the supply of services have to announce in advance to the Swiss authorities 8 days prior to the deployment, detailing name and social security numbers; in certain cantons very drastic penalties apply in case of infringements. The announcement has to be made for each canton separately, an unnecessary burden for businesses active in several place (e.g.: maintenance agreements).\nDeposit requirement for foreign service providers\nArticle 2(3) of the Swiss law on the minimal working conditions of posted workers authorises the discriminatory extension to foreign service providers of a deposit obligation prior to the supply of the service by means of a collective bargaining agreement.\nUniversal Application of Collective Agreements (\"Normalarbeitsvertr&auml;ge)\nThe EU-Swiss Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons provides for the possibility to set out rules for minimum wages for the protection for the posted workers. The Swiss law on posted workers grants the possibility to declare collective agreements universally applicable which covers the whole range of employments, wages, emoluments and other charges thus discriminating EU service providers. Furthermore, for determining the applicable reference wages inspectors apply frequently the highest wage category.\nObligation to contribute to control fees and charges\nArticle 7, paragraph 4a of the Swiss law on the minimal working conditions of posted workers which was introduced by law of 17 December 2004 and became applicable as of 1 April 2006 provides for the possibility to charge general control costs also to businesses providing services. Within collective agreements the Swiss government authorises trade unions and employers to levy discriminatory control charges at EU service suppliers calculated as yearly fees for businesses and monthly fees for workers. Furthermore, many collective agreements provide for a kick-back to Swiss businesses as the contribution to the Swiss employers organisation and the Swiss worker&rsquo;s contribution to trade unions can be deducted from those liabilities.\nDisproportionality of sanctions\nSwiss cantonal authorities have repeatedly imposed disproportionate sanctions, e.g. minor errors on wage declaration amounting to CHF 10 resulted in sanction of CHF 500.\nThe maximum applicable administrative sanction has been increased from CHF 5000 to 30000.\nBlacklists\nSanctions include a ban on business activities for up to 5 years in case of serious or repeated breach. EU companies subject to a ban are put on a publicly available blacklist.&nbsp;Since autumn 2016, for certain infringements, a ban on activities can be imposed under more lenient conditions than in the past or cumulative to the imposition of a fine.\n&nbsp;",

Costs for companies affiliated to the cantonal association of construction are only CHF 1.500.\nControl of the above-mentioned conditions is delegated to a commission composed of a president designated by the cantonal government and representatives from the social partners. The commission can impose very serious penalities. It can impose disciplinary sanctions up do CHF 30.000 and cancel registration in case of non-compliance. The commission has also the power to impose a criminal sanction of up to CHF 50.000 on companies who are active without registration.

However, for milk products the milk has to originate 100 % in Switzerland. On the other hand, for agricultural raw products that are impossible to be cultivated in Switzerland (e.g. cacao), this requirement does not apply.\nThe new legislation will enter into force on 1 January 2017.\nConcerning the watch industry, the ordinance governing the use of \"Swiss made\" for watches and clocks is being updated by the government.

The Federal Council has proposed new legislation which changes the reference from turnover in Switzerland to worldwide turnover. As a result, most EU businesses providing cross-border services in Switzerland would be required to register for and pay VAT. In addition, an EU based business would need a fiscal representative in Switzerland. Such a fiscal representative creates additional costs.\nIn addition, the rules for low value consignments which are exempt from VAT will be modified. Up to now, VAT below CHF5 was exempt. In the future, all imports from foreign companies with more than CHF 100.000 turnover from low value consignments will be subject to VAT (regardless of the value of the individual consignment). Coupled with high handling fees for customs procedures, this will make low value imports (notably through e-commerce) less attractive.\nThe measure is expected to enter into force on 1st January 2018.",

All production facilities of any new products sold in Nigeria are physically inspected and the import rights are linked to a Nigerian partner needed for the registration at the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC).\nAll products&nbsp;to be imported in the sectors of agriculture and fisheries, wines &amp; spirits, food and beverages, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and some&nbsp;other industries have to be registered at NAFDAC. The registration process is very complex and takes a long time. The continuous increase of registration fees is excessive and appears to be much higher for imported products compared to locally manufactured products. Since the NAFDAC procedures changed in 2002, NAFDAC representatives physically inspect all production facilities of any new products sold in Nigeria. This increases the costs. Companies have to register every product type and a separate registration fee has to be paid for different sizes of the same product type.\nForeign companies also complain that in practice it is too difficult to register their goods themselves at NAFDAC although the procedure allows for it. A Nigerian partner (such as a distributor) is required who registers the product in his name. Consequently the Nigerian partner (and not the foreign exporter) obtains the import rights, which can create problems in case the partner needs to be changed.

Moreover, the court interpretation of the trademark law provision appears to be discriminatory against foreign companies as such and in contradiction with the National Treatment principle.\nCanada must make patents available based on whether an invention is \"useful\" or possesses industrial applicability within the meaning of TRIPS, in fact, &sect; 2 of Canada's Patent Act reiterates the language used in TRIPS Article 27.1.\nHowever, the Canadian \"promise doctrine\" contravenes the utility standard under TRIPS Article 27.1 because WTO members, including Canada, do not have the discretion to modify substantive requirements of patentability, e.g. \"capable of industrial application,\" \"utility,\" or \"useful\"(ness). Furthermore, requiring that pharmaceutical inventions be capable of therapeutic utility as a criterion to determine whether the invention is \"useful\" is not permitted under the non-discrimination clause of TRIPS 27.1. Under that Article, Canada cannot impose additional or heightened patentability requirements for inventions having therapeutic or pharmacological applications as compared with other types of inventions.\nIn addition, the discriminatory impact of Canada's promise doctrine on the field of pharmaceutical innovations is clear in terms of both litigation rates and litigation outcomes. From the 1980s until the early 2000s, utility was challenged in an average of one or two judicial decisions per year. But since the advent of the promise doctrine, the number of utility decisions on pharmaceutical patents has spiked, with more than 60 decisions since 2005. By contrast, the number of utility decisions involving patents in all other technological fields combined has remained very low, with fewer than 10 decisions total since 2005. In the same time period, however, there have been 25 cases in which a pharmaceutical patent has been found invalid for lack of utility.\n&nbsp;",

Imports of those products originating in the NAFTA countries are counted against the global WTO tariff quota, whilst at the same time continuing to benefit from the preferential NAFTA duty rates.

Indeed, in October 2013, KSA notified labelling regulations for energy drinks that were more restrictive than EU ones; as a reaction to them EU submitted comments via the SPS/TBT WTO channels questioning these new requirements. Since then, KSA became the leading country of the Gulf Standards Organisation (GSO) and made sure that the rest of the members (6 in total) follow their views on energy drinks issues. &nbsp;As a result, the common GCC regulation on energy drinks has been notified by GCC members - by KSA under the number SAU 912.

            "description": "The registration in Mexico of foreign geographical indications (GI) as such is not possible and alternatives offer only weak and uncertain protection. This opens the way to a number of imitations and usurpations of European names and GI&rsquo;s, which affect the access to the market of the authentic products and raise confusion among consumers.\n&nbsp;\nBackground\nThe EU has a wide variety of protected GIs. They constitute an important pillar of the EU&rsquo;s quality policy on agricultural products and constitute a genuine interest for producers as they unlock value by capitalising on consumer&rsquo;s desire for diversity and quality products.\nThe registration of foreign GIs in Mexico remains difficult despite Mexico&rsquo;s obligations under the TRIPS Agreement. The national GI legislation is unclear as regards GI protection and inappropriate for foreign GIs. Another widespread practice which affects EU GIs in Mexico is the misuse of expressions such as \"tipo &hellip;\" or \"estilo &hellip;\" on labels. These branding practices generate unfair competition, consumer confusion and contribute to undermining the reputation and image of the genuine products.\nThe registration of a foreign GI as such is technically impossible in Mexico, since the legislation states that the Federal State is the owner of any Denomination of Origin (DO). The only ways for a European GI to obtain some protection within the Mexican territory are either registration as a collective trademark at the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (IMPI), or being covered by the Lisbon Agreement (of which Mexico is a party) or by the EU-Mexico bilateral Spirits Agreement signed in 1997. The EU &ndash; Mexico Free Trade Agreement (FTA) does not offer any protection to GI other than spirits.\nSome EU right holders have tried without success for a long time to protect their rights via the trademark system, which handles applications in a sometimes non consistent way (e.g. Parma Ham). Registration of a GI as a collective trademark provides a weak protection since the compliance to the Mexican quality standard is voluntary (while it is compulsory for Mexican DO), and also because any disputes would have to be solved in court, which involves lengthy, costly and uncertain procedures.\nBesides the registration related difficulties encountered by right holders for their GIs registered in the EU and/or under the Lisbon agreement, there is wide consumer confusion on the use of names or distinctive signs of EU countries and regions for all sorts of products.\nMain cases\nJerezSome Mexican wines bear the indication Jerez or \"tipo Jerez\" on their labels. Since the bilateral EU &ndash; Mexico spirits agreement does not apply to wines, and Spain is not a member of the Lisbon Agreement, the Jerez Consortium can only refer to TRIPS (not explicitly translated into Mexican law) to seek protection against the usurpation of the name.\nManchegoMexico has a long history of production and consumption of so called \"manchego\" cheese (a product elaborated from cow milk, as opposed to sheep milk as for the original Spanish product) and for this reason the term manchego became a generic in Mexico in 1984 (as defined in the Mexican industrial standard NMX-F-462-1984). Mexico held a consultation process related to the cancellation of this Manchego norm. Thus it is currently not possible to challenge the use of this name by Mexican producers and distributors. This confusing situation has opened the way to importation in Mexico of imitations of Manchego, with similar characteristics to the Spanish cheese, produced in third countries.\nProsciutto di ParmaHam consumption in Mexico exceeds 120.000 tons per year, which places it as a key export market for EU producers of cured ham. The Consorzio del Prosciutto di Parma has endeavoured for years to protect its rights, be it through the trademark system or as a GI via the Lisbon Agreement. It has launched several legal actions but remains to date without any legal instrument against the widespread use of trademarks encompassing the term \"Parma\". IMPI rejected the application by the Consorzio for the trademark \"Prosciutto di Parma\" on the ground that it was generic, but did register the trademark \"Parma\" in favour of a company unrelated to the Consorzio. This trademark has been used for commercialising hams unrelated to the EU and the Lisbon-protected GI. In 2002, IMPI refused to protect the GI \"Prosciutto di Parma\" notified under the Lisbon Agreement on appellations of origin, arguing on the existence of a prior trademark.

            "description": "Mexican labelling requirements are in many cases complex and difficult to comply with. Main affected sectors are textiles and&nbsp;ceramic tiles. Mexico requires information on the labels which is different from, or in addition to, internationally agreed practices. This implies additional costs for EU exporters who have to design specific labels for the Mexican market.\n&nbsp;\nBackground\nEU exporters of consumer products such as textiles and ceramic tiles have complained about the burdensome and costly labelling requirements in Mexico. Labelling in a permanent manner is often required for the Mexican market. These requirements imply that European companies have to dedicate significant resources to study the Mexican labelling requirements, to gather information and&nbsp; to perform specific tasks for complying with Mexican rules.\nMain cases\nTextilesMexican labelling requirements for textile products are more trade restrictive than necessary and have a negative impact on EU textile exports. EU exporters complain about excessive labelling requirements regarding the indication of size, trademark, name of the manufacturer and data on the importer which are considered burdensome and entailing additional costs. In fact, this implies designing a special label for the Mexican market i.e. it is not possible to use the same label for all Spanish speaking countries which would make sense in economic terms. In practise, before producing a label, exporters may have to send their customers a pro-forma invoice so that importers can verify the information provided. Many companies have opted to use a permanent label with the information required even if some might be given through a non-permanent one. Importers or manufacturers use in many cases voluntarily the services of Verification Units, which are private entities authorised to control the conformity of labels with Mexican rules, which cause high costs.\nThe EU requests that the obligation to indicate the name and address of manufacturer or importer in the label of textile products is eliminated in particular because this information exists normally in the customs accompanying documents and that customs controls are accelerated and kept on a random basis in particular because textile products do not pose serious health risks. Tests of Mexican authorities to verify products conformity with Mexican legislation should be done without delay and after the products have been released in the market (i.e. immediate customs clearance before test results are known).\nCeramic TilesEU exporters of ceramic tiles face the difficulty and extra costs of excessive labelling requirements. This includes putting specific labels for the Mexican market on the products and/or labelling each package (instead of one label for one consignment) with specific information, such as the fiscal number of the importer, information which is normally not known at that stage, and other special characteristics to be respected for each label. This can also imply manual re-packaging of the goods in a customs warehouse, which is a costly process and leads to delays before goods can be marketed.\nThe EU has referred several times during the Special Committee on Standards and Technical Regulation to the problematic labelling requirements imposed by Mexico, particularly the obligation to indicate the name of the importer on each individual tile box. The EU has suggested that only the basic information should be required to be on the label, allowing for the rest to be stated on commercial support documents.",

            "description": "Excessive document requirements for importers are causing delays and represent a non-tariff barrier. EU companies report that customs procedures are sometimes not transparent nor consistent with the rules stipulated in the EU-Mexico Free Trade Agreement. These issues have been partially addressed in the recent customs reform of 2013.\n&nbsp;\nBackground\nCustoms procedures in Mexico continue being considered as inefficient mainly because of their complex and irksome technical requirements. A simplification of procedures and reduction of administrative costs would not only facilitate trade, but also release public resources that could be allocated more efficiently elsewhere, such as for security concerns or intellectual property (IP) enforcement.\nThe Government partially addressed these issues with a customs reform in 2008, as it sought to abolish the estimated price system, cancel the importers&rsquo; register, eliminate the need to present a formal certificate of origin for sensitive products and eliminate certain monopolistic measures such as the single channel for imports. Further encouraging steps to facilitate trade were taken in the recent customs reform of 2013, which was published as law in the official gazette on 9 December 2013 and came into effect on 10 December 2013 (Decreto por el que se reforman, adicionan y derogan diversas disposiciones de la Ley Aduanera).\nThe reform of 2013 aimed to reinforce trade facilitation by creating a customs electronic system, meaning that all import and export customs declarations are now to be filed electronically. Another important and long standing issue, which this reform addressed, was the abolishment of the obligatory use of custom brokers. Importers and exporters are able to carry-out their own customs clearance. As far as risk analysis is concerned, the reform eliminated a second round of customs inspection and established that the customs inspection has to be carried out with the use of non-intrusive technology.\nHowever, concerns remain at certain customs procedures such as the lack of prior notification of procedural changes and inconsistent interpretation of trade requirements at the different ports of entry.\nWith regard to security issues, the Government has been working on strengthening border control via updates of security control equipment and reinforced cooperation with the US, but customs&rsquo; role and capacity in combating illegal trade, notably piracy and counterfeit products remain weak, partly due to the fact that legislation does not grant them ex officio powers.",

            "description": "The process for marketing authorisations for pharmaceutical and agro-chemical products includes three stages and several actors. Therefore very few approvals are being awarded and delays the process of market access, which needs on average about 4 years.\n&nbsp;\nBackground\nCOFEPRIS was established in 2001 by breaking out various directorates of the Ministry of Health to enhance the risk management in the public health sector. In the 2008 public health sector reform the responsibility for the registration of about 10,000 pharmaceuticals and 40,000 medical devices was attributed to COFEPRIS. But COFEPRIS suffered from a lack of updated referentials to technical regulations and of well trained staff, offices, computers etc. This resulted in a backlog of registrations of medical and agro-chemical products. Since 2011 the situation has improved, although there are some on-going difficulties with the registration process of new molecules. The Commissioner, who is in office since March 2011, made effective administrative changes to reduce the administrative burdens (third party pre-validation, narrowing down the number of medical devices that need approval, i.e. exempting low risk ones), facilitated registrations and increased transparency of the institution. But the industry views that these initiatives are not enough to address appropriately the underlying problem of lack of resources and qualified staff of COFEPRIS.\nThe approval process is composed on 3 stages:1st stage: COFEPRIS (Comisi&oacute;n Federal para la Protecci&oacute;n contra Riesgos Sanitarios),2nd stage: CSG (Consejo de salubridad General) of the Ministry of Health and3rd stage: ISSSTE (Instituto de seguridad y servicios sociales de los trabajadores del estado) covering public workers - IMSS (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social) covering workers in the private sector and funded by both public and private sources - SP (Seguro Popular) covering unaffiliated persons and is publicly financed.\nThe 3rd stage seems to be the most problematic one. The first two stages approve the molecules for scientific use but the molecules are not approved for purchasing and using them for patients in the medical sector. Although COFEPRIS has a rejection rate of around 5% since 2010, IMSS has only released 4% of the molecules approved by COFEPRIS, down from 24% in 2011.\nEquivalency agreementsOn 5 October 2012, Mexico unilaterally granted recognition of sanitary registrations emitted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for new medicines. Equivalency was also granted to a number of other countries.\nRegistration of agro-chemical productsThe main problems for EU companies to register agro-chemicals are excessive delays, the confidentiality of provided information and unclear procedures. However, the situation in this context seems having improved in recent years.&nbsp;",

            "title": "Restrictions on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)",
            "description": "Mexico has traditionally imposed significant restrictions on foreign direct investment in a number of important economic sectors, which have been reserved to the State or to Mexican citizens, or where foreign participation is limited to certain ceilings. This has been a major barrier for access of EU (and other) companies to the Mexican markets, particularly in key services sectors, and also has an impact on the overall competitiveness of the Mexican economy. Furthermore, cumbersome procedures and weak rule of law impose additional costs on foreign investors in all sectors. However, since 2013 Mexico has undertaken the \"Pact for Mexico\" structural reforms in several key economic sectors such as the telecommunication, energy, labour, insurance and leasing sectors. These reforms aim, among other things, at opening the sectors for foreign investment. The content of their respective secondary legislation and its implementation will be key for the industry to determine the impact of the reforms.\n&nbsp;\nBackground\nRestrictions on foreign capital participation in Mexico have been eased through successive reforms. Sectors previously open only to NAFTA countries have subsequently been open to all foreign investors and foreign capital participation is allowed up to 100% in many industrial sectors.\nThe May 2013 telecommunication reform lifted the 49% limitation of foreign investors in fixed telephony and improved competition in the Mexican phone and television market. Foreign investors can have up to 49% ownership of radio broadcasters pending on a decision of the foreign investment commission. Existing television networks have to offer their free-to-air programming for no cost to cable operators and the latter have to carry all channels. Consequently, now foreign investors can offer triple play (internet, television and telephone over a single broadband connection) at national level.\nThe energy reform eliminated restrictions on private and foreign participation in the areas of production, imports and exports, refining, transport and storage of all types of oil products and derivatives. Starting from 2016, the commercialisation and importing of petrol will be liberalised. As from 2018 private actors can run petrol stations and from this year the government will no longer control the price to consumers. As for the electricity sector, the transmission of electricity will remain in the hands of the state (CFE) but CFE can sign contracts with private companies for construction and other services relating to the network. The reform also allows for the creation of a wholesale market between private actors for contracts above 3 MW and electricity transmission can take place between private contractors through a permit. The CFE will continue to operate the system for distribution of electricity.\nHowever, some restrictions remain in important economic sectors. These vary from outright prohibitions to ceilings on equity participation. As regards total prohibitions, these include the following sectors:&bull; Telegraphic and radio telegraphic services, radioactive materials, coinage and printing of money, postal service, control, supervision and surveillance of ports of entry are sectors reserved for the State in whole or in part.&bull; Non-cable radio and television services, development banks (law was modified in 2008), certain professional and technical services, and domestic transportation for passengers, tourism and freight, except for messenger or package delivery, remain completely reserved to Mexican nationals (art. 6 of the Foreign Investment Law).\nAs for ceilings on equity participation, the following sectors remain affected: &bull; Transport (land transportation): The Mexican government allows up to 49 % foreign ownership of 50-year concessions to operate parts of the railroad system, renewable for a second 50-year period. The Mexican Foreign Investment Commission and COFECO must approve ownership above 49 %. Also foreign express delivery service companies continue to complain that the Mexican legislation unfairly favours Mexican companies by restricting the size of trucks international carriers are allowed to use.&bull; Air passenger transport: Foreign ownership of Mexican airlines remains capped at 25 % and foreign ownership of airports is limited to 49 %. &bull; Real estate: Investment restrictions still prohibit foreigners from acquiring title to residential real estate in so-called \"restricted zones\" within 50 kilometres of the nation&rsquo;s coast and 100 kilometres of the borders. In all, the restricted zones total about 40 % of Mexico&rsquo;s territory. Nevertheless, foreigners may acquire the effective use of residential property in the restricted zones through the establishment of a 50-year extendable trust (called a fideicomiso) arranged through a Mexican financial institution that acts as trustee. &bull; Certain port services, some financial services and air transportation still have limitations on foreign ownership. In addition, for some of the sectors in which a 100 % foreign ownership is allowed, prior permission granted by the Investment Commission is required (Article 8 of the Foreign Investment Law).An additional cost for foreign investors include the complex administrative procedures caused by the lack of coordination between the local, state and federal authorities, and by the complexity, inefficiency and uncertainty of legal proceedings. The general weakness of rule of law is caused by lack of resources, lack of transparency, abuse of \"amparo\" procedures (judicial review for the protection of constitutional rights) and vulnerability to criminal intimidation. It is possible that interest groups will make use of the \"amparo\" possibilities to challenge some aspects of the reforms.&nbsp;",

This new legislation took effect as from 1 January 2013.\nUnder this Law, certain goods and services might be controlled by the State by means of four pricing control methods. Those goods and services comprise of petrol &amp; liquefied gas, electricity, nitrate &amp; NPK fertilisers, plant protection drugs, vaccines for live stocks and cattle, edible salt, milk for children under six years old, sugar, paddy &amp; rice, human-use preventive &amp; curative medicines used at health care establishments.\nIn accordance with the above Law, the Ministry of Finance adopted a Decision 1079/QD-BTC that entered into force 1 June 2014. It set arbitrary wholesale price ceilings for 25 dairy products for children under 6 years and deriving limits for retail prices. According to the Vietnamese authorities, the purpose of these measures has been price stabilisation. The Decision affected negatively the 5 biggest producers and importers.\nIn January 2017 the competence for the pricing control methods was transferred to the Minsitry of Industry and Trade that has consequently prolonged the measures (at least) till the end of March 2017.",

            "description": "Until 2007, Brazil maintained a reinsurance monopoly with IRB-Brasil Resseguros remaining the sole provider of reinsurance in Brazil. Complementary Law No. 126 of 15 January 2007 brought in significant changes to the reinsurance business, opening up the subsector to private, including foreign-owned and foreign-based re-insurance companies. Towards the end of 2010, Brazil adopted Resolutions 224 (amended by Resolution 232) and 225, which reversed the liberalisation achieved by the complementary law of 2007.\n&nbsp;\nBackground\nThe reinsurance sector was closed to competition until the adoption of Law No. 126 of 15 January 2007, aimed at liberalising the insurance, reinsurance, retrocession and intermediation sectors in Brazil, by abolishing the monopoly of the federal reinsurer IRB-Brazil Re. The aforementioned law foresees a gradual liberalisation: 60% of the market is reserved for suppliers located in Brazil for the first three years, while this share falls to 40% thereafter. Further, the activities of &ldquo;occasional&rdquo; reinsurers are capped. Brazil backtracked on those liberalisation initiatives by adopting the new Resolutions n&deg;&nbsp;225 and n&deg; 232 (amending resolution n&deg;&nbsp;224).\nResolution n&deg; 225 made it mandatory for any cession to be placed locally with reinsurers in Brazil, while Resolution n&deg; 224 prohibited the transfer of inter-company insurance premiums. Resolution n&deg; 232 has later on allowed for a 20% intra-group cession. All Resolutions became effective on the 1st of April 2011, with no formal consultation period having been held before and despite the strong concerns voiced both by the foreign industry and numerous stakeholders within Brazil.\nThe Brazilian Council of Private Insurance (CNSP) has issued recently a draft Resolution, additional to the aforementioned resolutions 225 and&nbsp;232, in which it stipulates the conditions under which the transfers of risk in reinsurance and retrocession transactions can be placed with other than local, admitted and occasional reinsurers exclusively when insufficient capacity supply is proven, regardless of prices and conditions offered by all such reinsurers.",

            "description": "The \"buy Brazil act\" law 12.349/10 of 15 December 2010 amended federal laws of public procurement at the federal, state and municipal levels as well as for public entities. Foreign companies can participate in international tenders, but must be legally established in Brazil to take part in national tendering. However, the law foresees a preference for goods and services produced in Brazil of up to 25%. Furthermore, a range of local content requirements is enforced in concessions, public works and other contracts from the State or State-controlled enterprises. Given the significant influence of the state-controlled sector due to its large size, discriminatory government procurement policies are a substantial barrier to EU exports.\n&nbsp;\nBackground\nThe Federal Constitution establishes as a general rule that public procurement must be preceded by a bid process. The general rules for tendering procedures are defined in the following federal laws: Law 8666/93 for administrative contracts (goods and services supplies), Law 8987/95 for public services provided through concessions or permissions and Law 11079/04 for services provided through public-private partnerships.\nLaw&nbsp;8666 of 21 June 1993 has established for federal, state and municipal levels the rules for administrative contracts and governmental procurement related to works, services, acquisitions, sales and leases. The Brazilian procurement law does not establish a preference margin in favour of domestic companies in the tendering procedures, but gave a preference for goods and services produced in Brazil, or by Brazilian companies, for bids equivalent in terms of price, quality and delivery time.\nTwo subsequent laws introduced new and significant procurement regimes:i) Law n&ordm; 10502/2002, on the electronic reverse auction. This has become the prevailing tendering mode at federal level. This law is applicable only to companies established in Brazil.ii) Law n&ordm; 12.462/2011 on the so-called \"regime diferenciado de contrata&ccedil;&atilde;o\", applicable among others to international sporting events, and large infrastructure projects. This regime is open to international tenderers.\nIn 19 July 2010, the Brazilian government amended Law No 8666/1993 with a provisional measure (later converted into Law 12349/2010, the so called \"Buy Brazil Act\") giving preference of up to 25% to Brazilian-owned firms under specific conditions to achieve economic growth, national technological innovation and employment. The conditions relate to i) local content of the goods or services being procured, and ii) specific R&amp;D activities performed by the tendering companies in Brazil. The new law gives Brazil also the possibility for specific strategic sectors to support Brazilian production for example in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector.&nbsp;\nFor participating in national tendering, foreign companies have to set up a Brazilian company in line with the requirements of the new law and to invest directly in the country to produce goods or services according to the Basic Productive Process (PPB - &ldquo;processo produtivo b&aacute;sico&rdquo;). PPB criteria are established by inter-ministerial decrees signed by the Ministers in charge of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade (MDIC) and of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI).\nBrazil has not signed the WTO plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA).",

This is because Canadian producers will be required to limit these raw materials in their domestically produced cheeses. The measure may also limit exports of other existing or new non-complying EU cheeses to Canada.The Regulations also establish a new system of import licensing. It applies in addition to the existing Canadian cheese import licensing system in place to manage Canada&rsquo;s cheese TRQ regime. The licensing system originally appeared to be quite burdensome but following discussions with Canada it appears the attestation procedure is less demanding than envisaged and testing will be carried out in a non-discriminatory manner. However, we will need to see how this will be applied in practice and over a longer period.",

These measures, taken as a whole and individually, increase the effective level of border protection in Brazil, whilst providing preferences and support to domestic producers and exporters, by inter alia (1) imposing a higher tax burden on imported goods than on domestic goods, (2) conditioning tax advantages to the use of domestic goods, and (3) providing export contingent subsidies. Whereas some of the specific measures at issue have existed for some years, the overall framework of tax advantages to operators in Brazil, in relation to taxation, has been strengthened since September 2012 with the adoption of new specific tax schemes and the revision or completion of existing ones, thus following a consistent pattern.\nSeveral of the main measures have been referred to the WTO in line with the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes.

KFS plans to extend further to structural wood-based panels, e.g. oriented strand board (OSB) and plywood, in about one year.&nbsp;So far there has not been much impact. The reason is that almost all treated wood in Korea is being marked by the Korean treatment companies. However, for sawn timber the situation will be very different since almost all of Korea&rsquo;s softwood timber is imported. And the shipper will have to ensure that the timber is properly marked before it will be cleared through Korean Customs. This will lead to substantial extra costs for manufacturers.",

            "description": "Chile applies an prohibition on the landing, trans-shipment and transit of swordfish caught in international waters from the fishing boats in Chilean harbours.\nBackground: After the EC initiated a case before the WTO as the prohibitions for port access constituted a barrier to trade, Chile filed a legal suit before the ITLOS (International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea). Both cases were suspended upon the conclusion of a Provisional Arrangement in 2001. A more permanent solution was found after bilateral negotiations in 2008 and 2009 and the EU-Chile Understanding concerning the conservation and management of swordfish stocks in the South Eastern Pacific was initialled by the two parties in 2008 (and its annex in 2009) in view of resolving the longstanding irritant. The EU and Chile jointly withdrew the cases pending in front of ITLOS and WTO, in December 2009 and in May 2010, respectively. The case under the EU&rsquo;s Trade Barriers Regulation is still open.\nIn June 2010 the Council adopted a Decision (Council Decision of 3 June 2010 on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the Understanding between the European Union and the Republic of Chile concerning the conservation of swordfish stocks in the South-Eastern Pacific Ocean (2010/343/EU). Official Journal of the European Union, L 155/1 of 22.6.2010) allowing for the signature by the EU of the Understanding and of an Agreement, in the form of exchange of letters on its provisional application.\nNevertheless, Chile has been unable to sign despite four invitations by the Council. However Chile has declared to be committed to find a positive and successful solution to the issue. No results were achieved in the bilateral meetings and contacts that took place in 2013 and 2014. On 24 March 2015 Chile indicated by Note Verbale that they are not in a position to sign the Understanding and that alternative solutions should be explored. An informal bilateral meeting took place in Santiago, Chile, on 6 July 2015, where Chile indicated its conditions for port access to EU vessels targeting swordfish. In 2016, follow-up meetings took place. The EU considers that swordfish is under the purview of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) which covers both the High Seas and the Chilean EEZ. Chile has not yet joined the IATTC but is planning to do so.)",

The recent Investment Code of 3 August 2016 introduces a few relevant modifications and no longer features the FEC (or \"51/49 rule\"), which continues nonetheless to apply by virtue of the Finance Laws of 2009 and 2014.&nbsp;\nThese measures, which have the effect of deterring foreign direct investment, include the following provisions:\n- generalised limitations on foreign ownership: minimum Algerian shareholding of 51 % for all sectors;\n- any foreign investment exceeding 5 billion DZD must be approved by the National Investment Council;\n- foreign investors must maintain a positive foreign-currency account for the whole duration of the investment and must secure the finance to cover project costs from local sources;\nThere are also some restrictions (more de facto than de jure, it seems) to the transfer of benefits generated through foreign investment. The financial transfers outside Algeria are an obstacle not only from the FDI perspective, but also with regard to commercial activities. One particular aspect of this general obstacle is illustrated by the difficulties encountered by the ship-owners, who have not been able since 2010 to repatriate credits deposited on their disbursement accounts whenever these credits accrued to the accounts after a period of 90 days of arrival of the goods. This problem has now been solved for future transactions by allowing the opening of complementary disbursement accounts for any payment effected after the initial 90 days of the arrival of the goods. However, the Algerian authorities are yet to allow ship-owners to transfer pre-existing credits, which accrued under the old regulation.\nThere are indications that the Government may be considering amending further the 51/49 rule and limiting its scope of application to certain sectors only (while stopping short of repealing the rule altogether).",

Moreover, it stipulates more transparency in the administration of permits of new vehicle registrations which should rom ow on be managed by the Transport Ministry. However, the truckers' sector criticised the Decree upon its publication denouncing the absence of any consultation with this sector in the drafting process.&nbsp; Ahead of an imminent threat of another&nbsp;strike Colombia started negotiations with the truckers and will probably elaborate&nbsp;the final legislation/legal regulation for the current Decree with them.&nbsp;A succesful implementation of the Decree is crucial&nbsp;for the accession process of Colombia to OECD.&nbsp;\nThe Decree 1517 was preceeded by several attempts by the Government to dismantle the discriminatory system which has been practically blocking imports of heavy trucks and suffered from vast corruption.\nOn 16 August 2013, Colombia issued the decree 1760 (which amended previous decree 2085 of 2008). Decree 2085 of 2008 stipulated that a new truck can only be registered if another vehicle corresponding to the same weight capacity (or several trucks corresponding in total to the same weight capacity) is physically scrapped or if a fee (in 2008 this corresponded to US$ 10.000 to 30.000) depending on the type of truck, is paid. The new decree 1760 eliminated the fee option, therefore restricting the import of a new truck by making it subject to the scrapping of an old one.\nThe scrappage scheme has been in place since 2003. Meanwhile, the EU together wth other partners (U.S., Mexico) has been pushing for the elimination of this barrier to trade in the car sector.&nbsp;",

New Zealand is in principle open for compartmentalisation proposals. However the economic feasibility of such options is difficult to achieve due to the low value of poultry meat. New Zealand is furthermore open to consider novel solutions taking into account the whole production chain focussing upon all available risk mitigation measures (hurdles) that could act to minimize the residual disease risk in trade for New Zealand (e.g. vaccination status, immunity levels, slaughter process, HACCP, specified cut options etc).

Up to now, Brazil did not clarify how and when it will definitively solve the backlog of market access applications filed by EU Member States.\nRegarding the verifications (audits) to exporting countries, MAPA has confirmed its decision to:\n# Focus the mentioned systems evaluations (audits) to the competent authorities of exporting countries (hopefully opening the door to pre-listing);\n# Pay its own expenses related to the mentioned evaluations (audits) to exporting countries; \n # No longer visit exporting countries to inspect and approve individual establishments.",

Uncooked pig meat may only be imported from Canada and New Zealand. One MS, Denmark, is able to export uncooked, de-boned pig meat to Australia, on the condition that the meat is heat treated before release on the market. Market prospects for value added products such as cooked bone-in hams and dried cured hams (such as Serrano and Parma type) have been identified.\nFurthermore, market prospects for fresh/frozen, deboned meat, might be interesting.

            "description": "Unjustified import restrictions on a number of animals and animal products relating to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (and other diseases). Recent Regulation 139/2014 seems a step towards progressive alignment with international standards of the OIE on BSE. In this respect, the Regulation opens for import from negligible status countries and seems to possibly open a door from imports from controlled status countries, though the wording is still not very clear. In any case, imports are very limited. Article 5 of the same regulation seems to favour local beef, though Indonesia rejects this view. Indonesian legislation requires both country and establishment approval (through both a declaration (questionnaire) and on-site assessment) for import of meat and meat products. This process is burdensome and non-transparent. The criteria for passing the approval process are unclear, thus resulting in a long approval procedure. Related to others diseases, Indonesia require absence of a number of diseases in a country or establishment for which OIE does not consider trade measures necessary. Indonesia introduced the principle of regionalisation in its legislation from 2009 only for foot and mouth disease (FMD) and not for other diseases for which OIE also foresees this principle.\nLaw 18/2009 introduced burdensome and non-transparent risk assessment procedures for meat and dairy imports stemming from country establishment approval requirements. Moreover, the law provided that all imported derived animal products have to be certified &rsquo;halal&rsquo;. Law 18/2009 introduced a country and establishment approval entailing that every single exporting establishment need to be inspected. The procedure requires that foreign companies exporting fresh animal products (meat, dairy products, eggs etc.) have to register which are then to submit to plant-by-plant inspections. The Regulation 139/2014 still request country and establishment audit and approval.\nHalal matters are also a significant complication.\nTrading conditions (not SPS) set in regulation 139 2014 and later in 58/2015 make even more complicated market access: restrictions on certain cuts and products, use of reference prices, an unclear and complex import license system....\nNew policies are planned without consulting trading partners, potentially completely banning or severely obstructing imports.\nSince the introduction of the ban in 2001 the EU together with trading partners have consistently raised the issue in all available fora, and in bilateral meetings.\nUpdate: the regulation 58/2015 apparently might allow imports of countries with controlled risk status, though the wording make this unclear. The EU is still trying to get clarification on this. As mentioned, a number of non-strictly SPS barriers are still present in this regulation. The EU has raised concerns.\nUpdate: the regulation 34/2016 continues the same pattern, with apparently allowed imports from countries with controlled risk status but unclear procedures and requirements. The COM made comments in writing but no feedback has been received.\nThe FTA negotiations will probably&nbsp;offer a better scenario for constructive dialogue",

            "description": "(a) Protection of GIs:\n1. In accordance with the Agreement between the EC and Canada on trade in wines and spirit drinks, Canada shall take the necessary steps to have the EC names listed in Annex of the Agreement entered on the list of protected geographical indications in Canada after an application for registration has been made in good and due form. The Canadian authorities have indicated that under normal circumstances the application process to protect a name as a GI would take about six months. However, ever since the signing of the Agreement, with a few exceptions, the application process has taken at least twice or three times that long. For a number of Italian wine names, the process has taken almost 4 years. In addition, no temporary protection is provided during the period necessary to review the application.\n2. The Government of Canada has arguably identified some irregularities within Canada&rsquo;s list of protected GIs. In particular, a number of entries on the list cover multiple GIs when, as per Canada&rsquo;s policy, they must cover only one. In Canada&rsquo;s administrative procedures for the protection of a GI as detailed in \"Canada&rsquo;s Process to Request Geographical Indications for Wines and Spirits to be Entered on Canada&rsquo;s List of Protected GIs\", it is stated: \"Any request for a GI to be added to the list of protected GIs must identify only one GI (&hellip;). Any alternate expressions, compositions or spelling sought to be entered on the list of protected GIs must be submitted in a separate request\".\nCanada has launched a new policy regarding the separation of multiple-term names requiring that each multiple-term name will have to be separated and resubmitted in separate applications, if the applicant still wants both (or possibly more) names listed on Canada&rsquo;s list of protected GIs. However, the CDN $450 fee paid for the initial application will only cover one of the applications. Each subsequent one would require another $450. On the other hand, already protected multiple-term GIs will be separated without additional cost. There are over 70 applications pending, mostly from Italy.\n(b). Conflicts between trade marks and European GIsEU GIs face difficulties, among others where names are used as generic names or face the issue of prior Trademarks. CDN legislation is based on a first in time, first in right principle, hence the problem is of prior Trademarks preventing the registration of EC GIs as certification marks, or even preventing the use of the name to sell on the CND market.\nWe are concerned by the misuse of certain EU GIs, for instance Gorgonzola, Asiago [IT], Noix de Grenoble [FR], Bayonne Ham [FR]. Although not linked to GIs, a problem with a similar impact concerns labelling of Canadian-produced food using terms such as \"Serrano\" together with Spanish-looking packaging for cured hams, to mislead consumers into thinking they are purchasing Spanish products and thereby giving an unfair market share over, in this case, Spanish meat products.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

            "description": "The Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 ('FINSA') amends the so-called Exon-Florio amendment of the Defense Production Act of 1950, which authorises the US President to investigate foreign acquisitions, mergers, and takeovers of, or investments in, US companies from a national security perspective. In 2008, final regulations that implement FINSA were published. These regulations complete the reform of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ('CFIUS'), an inter-agency committee chaired by the US Treasury to which the US President's review and decision-making authorities provided by the Exon-Florio amendment have been delegated.\nThe US President and CFIUS have blocked only 2 investments so far (in the 1990s and one in 2012). However, this figure conceals some worrying practices and trends. First of all, there are a growing number of investors, who, after having filed to CFIUS, renounce their envisaged investment in the US and withdraw their filing. Investors are said to be uncertain about CFIUS review and fear negative decisions which could seriously impact on the image of the company.\nWhile statutory timetables have not changed, caution within CFIUS has resulted in longer review times. CFIUS has also increased the number of mitigation agreements as a condition for approval and new, unprecedented terms for CFIUS approval have also emerged, i.e. evergreen provisions, which give the US Administration the capacity to re-open the terms of the agreement and even undo the investment under certain circumstances. This practice is a departure from the 'safe harbour' against a future divestment order that CFIUS approval was understood to provide.\nThe performance of CFIUS and the Committee's manner of reviewing cases involving foreign governments has been questioned by some Members of Congress and others, in particular as regards the emergence of direct investments through sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). On June 30, 2011 the,&nbsp;Obama administration issued a statement supporting an open investment policy, committing itself to treat all investors in a fair and equitable manner and supporting business investment from sources domestically as well as abroad.\nFurthermore, the Obama administration launched, on October 31, 2013, a new initiative (\"Select USA\") with the objective of attracting more FDI to the U.S. The program aims to put the promotion of exports and the attraction of foreign investments into the U.S. on an equal footing in terms of importance in the U.S. foreign policy.",

            "title": "Procurement: Buy American",
            "description": "\nThe EU and US are both signatories to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (\"GPA\"). GPA is currently the only legal instrument which governs the access of the EU suppliers/service providers and their supplies and services to the US government procurement market.\nGPA imposes a non-discrimination and transparency obligation. However, the obligations of the GPA apply only to the specific entities and sectors covered.\nThe US GPA commitments are limited by way of various derogations. Also, only 37 States are committed to the GPA and with a limited scope. The broadest exemptions to the scope of the GPA concern the Buy American restrictions linked to Federal funding of procurement in specific areas as well as the broad set-asides for US small and medium sized enterprises.\nCurrently regional or local US authorities and most other sub-central entities within US States have no legal obligation to treat bids from European companies on an equal footing with US companies.\nIn fact many barriers have been erected against foreign bidders in the US procurement market and European companies currently face many obstacles that either prevent or significantly reduce their chances of winning government contracts in the US.\nThe most important obstacles that European companies typically encounter both with respect to the US Federal Government as well as in US States are for example:\n\nVarious types of \"Buy American\" restrictions; When European companies bid for government contracts, their bids may be subject to discriminatory treatment or even find it excluded from consideration because the US law allows government offices to require use of American and local goods, services, suppliers and service providers or at least give them special favourable consideration.\nUS SME preference policy, which reserves about 23% of the value of US government contracts to US SMEs.\nLarge share of procuring entities within US States are not covered by any commitments and they are therefore not obliged to treat EU bidders on the same footing as US companies for procurement.\nLack of transparency: It is not easy to find proper and timely information on government contracts opportunities in the US. There is no general access point (apart from the Federal tenders) to information on opportunities to bid for government contracts and the information is provided is often unclear.\n\n\n\nUS Federal Government level\n\nThe US Federal Government applies a Buy American policy on Federal procurement (contracts which the Federal agencies conclude) and also on procurement which the Federal Government funds within the States (contracts concluded with Federal money).\nSome US Federal agencies (such as the Federal Aviation Administration), are still obliged to discriminate against EU businesses on the basis of the 1933 \"Buy American Act\".\nIn addition, restrictions based on the so called \"Berry Amendment\" establish that only US-products (including procurement of \"non-war\" material such as textiles) can be procured by the US Department of Defense.\nFurthermore, Federal agencies apply a mandatory set-aside for US SMEs for 23 % of the value of Federal procurement. EU companies cannot bid for those contracts unless they fulfil the requirements such as to be established and pay taxes in the US and employ US labour.\nUS also exclude EU suppliers in procurement of for instance \"dredging services\" under the GPA. EU companies do therefore not have access to these contracts at US ports. The background for this restriction is with the \"Jones Act\", which prohibits foreign made dredgers to work there.\n\"Buy America\" restrictions:\n\nOne of the most fundamental obstacles for access to US procurement is a result of the \"Buy America Act\", which is a provision of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 and applies to mass-transit related procurement. Restrictions concern procurement funded by the US Federal Government's Department of Transportation (Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration, Federal Railroad Administration and Federal Aviation Administration).\nThe actual procurement contracts are concluded by States or entities within States, such as cities. On the basis of Buy America-restrictions, the Federal Government imposes US content requirements on procurement (that can go up to 100 %). These domestic content restrictions have been carved out from the scope of GPA commitments. The restrictions are effectively enforced as the sub-central recipient is bound to respect the funding conditions containing a Buy America obligation.\nConsequently, if a European bidder wants to tender for procurement contracts using Federal funds for example in a project to build new railway infrastructure, it must prove that it uses steel, iron and manufactured products produced in the US instead of using steel or products manufactured in Europe.\nBuy America type of provisions have become a regular feature of bills funding Federal grants to the states, municipal or transit authorities. Restrictions have also extended to areas outside of transportation, such as environmental infrastructure projects. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) adopted in 2014, which imposed new and permanent Buy America restrictions on procurements funded by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Water infrastructure fund.\nThe US Federal Government continues to introduce new laws or budget appropriations which either extend the scope of existing Buy America restrictions or impose new ones. One of the most recent legislative amendments by the US Federal Government adding stricter Buy America rules is the &ldquo;Fixing America&rsquo;s Surface Transportation Act&rdquo; (FAST Act). The FAST Act, which President Obama signed on December 4, 2015, reauthorizes surface transportation programs through fiscal year 2020. In doing so, it increases the domestic content requirements for rolling stock (such as buses) from the current 60% of the cost of all components to 65% for fiscal years 2018-19 and to 70%, beginning in FY 2020. The DOT&rsquo;s Federal Transit Administration, which provides funding to local public transit systems, including buses, subways, light rail, commuter rail, trolleys and ferries, will implement the new requirements. The FAST Act also tightens the waiver process applied by the Federal Transit Administration.\n\n\n\n\nIt should also be noted that in order to be able to bid for contracts by Federal agencies, it is necessary to register with the System for Award Management (SAM). &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nUS State level procurement\n\nThe commitments made by the US at State level under the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) are limited in scope. Furthermore, the States' legal framework in procurement is very fragmented, which causes de factor barriers. Each of the US States has their own laws and they apply various levels of their own &ldquo;Buy American&rdquo; requirements giving favourable treatment to products which have been manufactured in the US. In particular, 27 States impose obligations within state-law to give favourable treatment to \"American made products\". Furthermore, some States impose obligations to favour US manufactured products when local entities use State-funds. These impose obligations to supply US manufactured products.\nIn addition, many States also impose preferences which give favourable treatment to products manufactured within a specific State. On top of State-law based preferences, additional requirements are applied for example by many US cities. Finally, many US States apply specific set-asides for US SMEs established within their respective State.\n\n\nWith regard to US States, only specific entities of 37 States out of the 50 US States have to follow the GPA rules, such as non-discrimination with respect to EU businesses. These are typically entities of State Government while for example cities are not covered by the GPA obligations. A majority of procuring entities within US States are not obliged to treat EU bidders on the same footing as US companies. A majority of procuring entities within US States are not obliged to treat EU bidders on the same footing as US companies. An example of an explicit exclusion from the scope of commitments is the procurement of vehicles by the States of Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New York, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Wyoming.\nAlso States have a trend of imposing new and additional Buy America-restrictions. Recently both New Jersey and New York proposed to introduce new Buy America-laws. These legislative bills were, however, withdrawn at last stage.\n\n\nThe lack of easy access to information on procurement opportunities in the US States is a key deterrent to participate in US procurement. EU businesses can bid for contracts only if they are able to find information on them. EU companies need to navigate through hundreds of different procurement portals and suffer from various obstacles to register as bidders. In many States, in order receive information on contracts and in order to bid, companies first have to register with the State. For this each State applies its own requirements. Some States require a payment to register as a bidder. Registration requirements act as further market access obstacles.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n",

            "title": "Maritime: Cabotage restrictions",
            "description": "US cabotage restrictions are the effect of various provisions contained in US legislation and regulations, often collectively (and to a certain extent erroneously) referred to simply as the \"Jones Act\"[1]. Such legislative measures were enacted as from 1920 with the objective of ensuring the maintaining of a national fleet designed to protect American national defence (and &ndash; at the time &ndash; to allow for the selling of superfluous cargo ships built during WWI). There are clear indications that the economics are not in favour of the Jones Act. However, it creates and preserves jobs for the constituents and therefore gains bipartisan support. Moreover, whilst the economic benefits of the Jones Act are concentrated, the costs are diffuse. This explains why the several attempts made over a century to render such rules less restrictive have all failed. For maritime commercial entities to be able to benefit from the exclusive opportunities offered to them by the Jones Act and relating cabotage legislation (e.g. operation of US coastal trading and relating services), the vessels that they operate must be: US built, US owned, US maintained, and US crewed; furthermore, maritime commercial entities must be US controlled. It should be noted that cabotage legislation which restricts maritime transportation between ports of the same country is common everywhere in the world (and to a certain extent also in the EU). What makes the US legislation peculiar and unduly restrictive is the fact that domestic transportation &ndash; even when carried out by US operators - can only be performed by using vessels which are US built, US owned/controlled, US crewed and US maintained. These requirements, add to the effects of traditional cabotage measures important limitations in terms of shipbuilding (because no foreign built ship can be used), establishment (because only companies owned and controlled by Americans can carry out coastal trade services) and repair services (because vessels repaired/reconverted outside the US risk losing the necessary qualifications to operate again within US waters).\n&nbsp;\n[1] The Jones Act is detailed as Chapter 24 (Merchant Marine Act, 1920) of the Appendix to Title 46 (Shipping) of the United States Code. The Code is the codification by subject matter of the general and permanent laws of the United States, published every six years (since 1926) by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the U.S. House of Representatives. The Jones Act is actually only one of several related pieces of legislation that shape cabotage rules in the US.",

            "description": "Overly bureaucratic process for getting on to the registry for public contracts. Difficult for companies to get academic qualifications of their workers recognised. Applications need many notarised documents (e.g. certificates of good conduct of workers, certification of previous projects), which are very difficult to provide for foreign companies. Projects ask for a \"RUT\" - a local tax identification number which is difficult to obtain for foreign companies. Many original documents are needed as part of the registration process for the \"registro de consultores\". This is time consuming, but also difficult for foreign companies that have worked all over the world and may need to present original documents from various countries. Experience of sister companies is not recognised.\nThis issue was raised at several trade counsellor meetings since 2013 and MAAC since 2014. The EU delegation dialogue with the Ministry of Public works (MOP) and Ministry of Health do not show results so far. The Direction General on Economic International Relations on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has committed to coordinating the work with the ministries involved to ensure compliance with the EU Chile Association Agreement.\nRegistry for public consultants and contractors:\nIn August 2014 the EU Delegation provided comments to the Ministry of Public works (MOP) regarding a draft proposal with changes to the regulation of the registry of consultants and contractors. Public procurement, including the recognition of professional titles, was on the agenda of the Association Committee on 2014 and 2015. The EU Delegation offered MOP the possibility to use EU funds (TAIEX instrument) to convey EU best practices through capacity building in the public procurement procedures. So far the response from MOP has not been positive.\n\nMany original documents are needed as part of the registration process for the \"registro de consultores\".\nMany unnecessary notarised documents (certificates of good conduct of workers, certification of previous projects etc.) are needed.\n\"RUT\" (a tax identification number which foreign companies obviously don't have) is required.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nExperience of sister companies is not recognised.\nThe Regulation on Consultants by the MOP requires, for registration/bidding purposes, consortia with foreign consultants to include at least a national consultant with a minimum participation of 30% of the value of the contract.\nThe same legislation does also, under certain conditions, prohibit foreign companies from participating in tender procedures.\nThe regulation relating to public works by the Ministry of Health provides discriminatory provisions giving higher value to local experience (80%) than experience gathered abroad (20%).\nAlso the application by MOP of dictamen 22728 by the General Comptroller is not recognising experience and/or studies acquired before the recognition in Chile of a foreign diploma. Issues related to the recognition of professional titles (responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) were raised in the Association Committee on 6 November 2014 and 2015.\nThe Contraloria Dictamen 22728 of 13 April 2011 on the recognition of work experience abroad is discriminatory against foreign workers when applied in the area of public procurement. A meeting on recognition of diplomas between the EU and with the Universidad de Chile, which is the responsible authority for the homologation of professional titles, has been refused several times in 2014 and 2015. It has been rescheduled for 2016.\n",

            "description": "Imports of EU electronic and fuel burning products have to go through a burdensome two-step certification procedure. Certificates or tests carried out in the origin country, although valid in Chile, must be completed with tests in Chile which increase the cost for importing goods. This requirement also applies for products certified in their country of origin by internationally recognized laboratories and which are based on international standards. In addition, the foreign certificates also have to be validated by the Chilean consulate in the country of origin.\n&nbsp;\nBackground\nSafety requirements for electronic and fuel products published as Chilean regulations (NCh) are based largely on standards of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC standards).\nIn the case of imports, Decree 298/2005 introduced a so-called \"Special Certification System\", which provides for recognition of foreign certificates issued by foreign conformity assessment bodies (CABs). This system consists of a two-step procedure: (1) a \"Resolution\" issued by the Superintendencia de Electricidad y Combustibles (SEC); and (2) a \"Certificate of Approval\" issued by CABs. Moreover, the system requires additional sample testing of a batch, albeit a simplified testing and not for the whole analysis of a product. Only CABs authorised by SEC can provide certificates of approval. In addition to being a cumbersome process, the foreign certificates also have to be validated by the Chilean consulate in the country of origin.\nChile notified to the WTO amendments to Decree 298/2005 in both 2010 and in 2013 as further modifications were made, to which the EU provided comments at both instances. However, due to the complexity of modernizing the bill, the process was suspended in November 2013.&nbsp;There are no plans to review the Decree to allow for&nbsp;self-certification by the manufacturer, as Chile has been underlining at recent meetings of the TBT committee of the EU-Chile Association Agreement. The&nbsp;issue is closely monitored by the EU Delegation to Chile.\nThe EU conformity assessment procedure for electronic products is less cumbersome, irrespective of whether the manufacturer is located in the EU or abroad. The manufacturer has only to provide a Supplier&rsquo;s Declaration of Conformity (SDoC), make the technical documentation available and place the \"CE\" marking on the product as proof of compliance with the relevant EC legislation (safety directive for low voltage products (LVD) and the electromagnetic compatibility directive (EMC)). However, in Chile, EU electronic products have to undergo the above mentioned cumbersome procedure that in turn increases the cost for imported goods.",

            "description": "The marketing authorisation procedure concerning new pharmaceuticals and agro-chemicals does not provide enough assurance that tests and other undisclosed data submitted by right holders are not used by third parties to register their \"new\" pharmaceutical products. The implementing regulations for data protection for agro-chemicals do not refer clearly to data exclusivity and, in any event, do not provide clearly for non-reliance.\n&nbsp;\nBackground\nAfter a lengthy process of discussions and consultations by the Ministry of Health, including mediation by the European Commission, Decree 107 amending and replacing Decree 153 of 2005, was published at the end of 2010 and provided clearer implementing rules for data protection for pharmaceuticals. Decree 107 modified the system of protection of undisclosed data and the marketing authorisation procedure.\nNotwithstanding, Chile&rsquo;s industrial property law 19.039, Article 89, and as reflected in Decree 107, still raises the concern regarding the circumstances in which data protection can be limited or refused in case of publication of some (innocuous) test data on the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) website or in Chile (or elsewhere). In other words, prior voluntary disclosure of innocuous data by the owner made in the interest of transparency can still justify denial of data exclusivity.\nChile&rsquo;s industrial property law (Art.91(e)), and as reflected in Decree 107, prevent data exclusivity protection if a pharmaceutical or agro-chemical product marketing approval application is filed in Chile after 12 months from the date when the first registration is granted in another country. This is apparently a particularly short deadline for EU companies which may render practically impossible registration and entry on the Chilean market. Although the deadline starts counting from the day of obtaining (and not the filing) the first marketing authorisation internationally, it still is a time limit and not all companies have Chile in their market strategy at the time (e.g., certain virus/the disease may not exist in Chile at the time).\nMoreover, this is particularly difficult for agro-chemicals because it seems that Chile&rsquo;s regulatory requirements for product assessment prevent registrants from meeting the 12 month novelty bar described above. More specifically, before submitting a market approval request, the &ldquo;Servicio Agricola Ganadero&rdquo; (SAG) needs to approve experimental trial protocols and requires submission of local seasonal efficacy trial results. Both regulatory proceedings demand at least 24 months to comply with. Thus, compliance with Chilean regulatory requirements prevents meeting fixed deadlines for data exclusivity protection eligibility.\nIn addition, delays in deciding on the grant of IPRs by the Chilean Industrial property Institute (INAPI), including patents, can be significant. Notwithstanding, modifications to Chile&rsquo;s IP system considers changes that should expedite and streamline the patent application process.&nbsp;\nOn 10 March 2014, the Chilean Service for Agriculture and Livestock (SAG) adopted a regulation on equivalence registry. In order to promote generics, this regulation allows a third party to obtain marketing authorization without submitting test data for molecules without a patent or which do not have data protection. Even if, according to Chilean law, data protection is granted with the application upon request, the company does not receive a document stating that such protection has been required together with the application and the document providing marketing authorization does not confirm that&nbsp; the protection has been granted.&nbsp; This leaves the company that first generated the data without legal documentation to defend itself against third parties registration.",

Physical counterfeiting and piracy continue to pose a serious and very visible problem in Thailand and although some progress has been made over time, effective protection of trademark rights and copyrights from infringement is far from guaranteed in Thailand. Ensuring an effective form of landlord liability could make a positive contribution in the fight against illicit trade but as of yet no specific measures to this end are being contemplated. The globally growing problems of copyright piracy and trademark counterfeiting on the Internet have emerged as new challenges, and in this context right holders have strong reservations about the efficiency of a recently introduced 'notice-and-takedown' procedure. In the field of patents, a major concern is the fact that after years of ineffectiveness in the substantive examination of patent applications the DIP is facing a formidable backlog. Although potentially positive signs have recently emerged, including e.g. an increase in the number of examiners, these measures may still take much time before they will have an effect on the considerable delays in patent examination and issuance, especially for complex chemical and pharmaceutical products. Thailand would do well to further open up the consultation process on legislative amendments, e.g. by improving inter-ministerial consultation, by making available full draft texts and by expanding the circle of consulted stakeholders.",

This causes an increase in the cost of the final price.\n\nSince 2006, ceramic tiles have to qualify for technical requirements (&ldquo;cahier des charges&rdquo;) while these requirements do not apply to local production. In the last years, it has got more complicated to obtain the approval of the authorities regarding the technical requirements. The procedures to obtain the approval are blocked constantly. The authorities have seven days to check the goods but they do not fulfil the time limitation. Samples have to be tested twice a year.\nCeramic tiles imports have to pay a 10% of the imported value before they can enter the Tunisian market (&ldquo;avance d&rsquo;imp&ocirc;t&rdquo;).

            "description": "In 2009, Malaysia removed the requirement for a Foreign Investment Committee (FIC) to screen proposed investments and repealed FIC Guidelines on the acquisition of interests, mergers, and takeovers, thereby reducing the minimum equity requirement for bumiputera in locally incorporated companies from 30 % to 12.5% for newly listed companies. With the abolishment of the Foreign Investment Committee, Malaysia removed its all-round foreign equity ceiling of 70%. Despite the fact that the general cap is removed, foreign equity restrictions remain in certain sectors. These are imposed by the different Ministries, rather than by a central body. Apart from formalized regulation on the matter, Ministries may also impose equity restrictions as a condition to obtain a license.\nA separate set of regulations is imposed to reserve equity in businesses for ethnic Malays or Bumiputera. The rationale is to increase business participation of the Bumiputera. While ethnic Malays are the majority racial group in Malaysia, they are underrepresented in the country&rsquo;s business community, which is largely made up of ethnic Chinese and Indians.\nIn these cases, the restrictions on foreign equity are not in favour of nationals of Malaysia, but ethnic Malay. In other words, a foreign invested company where the non-foreign equity is held by individuals who aren&rsquo;t ethnically Malay would still fall foul of the law. The issue continues to be politically sensitive.\nAreas which are subject Bumiputera reservations include banking and finance, water, batik production, agriculture, defense, energy and telecommunications.\nGenerally, investment in manufacturing is fully liberalised but investment in services remains subject to foreign equity caps in many sectors.\nNevertheless, the Government retains the authority to review and approve all investments by both domestic and foreign investors through the issuing of licences by the relevant Ministries, which generally enjoy full discretion in regard to licensing decisions. The licensing requirement applies to investment in manufacturing over RM 2.5 million, or having more than 75 employees. Licenses are required to carry out nearly all services activities. Foreign equity caps remain, notably for investment in telecommunications (70% for network services/facilities providers), oil and gas services (49%), insurance (70%), and transport. Foreign investment in newly privatised entities is limited to 25%. Malaysia makes extensive use of investment incentives and performance requirements are imposed on investors.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;",

            "description": "It appears that the Thai Liquor Act discriminates against imported spirits in favour of local ones in various aspects. Local white spirits are taxed at a lower rate than imported white spirits.&nbsp; Some local fruit wines (made from grape wine imported in bulk with minor addition of other fruit juice, bottled/packaged and marketed similarly to grape wine) are subject to a lower excise tax rate than regular imported grape wine. Additionally, wines with last wholesale price higher than 600 baht/bottle are subject to excise tax based on both ad valorem and specific basis while wines with last wholesale price of no more than 600 baht/bottle are only subject to specific excise tax. These factors allow the said local fruit wines to compete in the market at price advantage. Apart from the discriminatory excise tax, the sale license fee regime also discriminates against imported products.\n&nbsp;\nCurrently, the Liquor Act is being made an integral part of the Excise Tax Code, which will combine all different excise tax laws into a single Act and will harmonise tax base at ''suggested retail price''. For alcohol products, the draft Excise Tax Code also indicates a move towards specific tax rates by imposing much higher specific tax ceilings and lower ad valorem tax ceilings. According to the draft Act, the discrimination in sale license fees will be eliminated. Based on our discussion with the Excise Tax Department, the discrimination in tax rates between local fruit wines and imported grape wines will be eliminated while the discrimination in tax rates between local white spirits and imported ones will be maintained. However, the price threshold system in wine will be maintained (adjusting from last whole sale price to suggested retail price) and the system may be extended to other spirits. Whether this would continue to constitute/increase discrimination or not would depend on the levels of threshold.\n&nbsp;",

            "description": "The Foreign Business Act 1999 (FBA) lays out the overall framework governing foreign investment in Thailand. The FBA sets out a maximum of 49 per cent limitation on foreign ownership in all service businesses (with only company-by-company provisional exemptions). In the past few years, Thailand attempted to tighten the law by adding new criteria used to qualify companies as foreign referring not only to ownership limitation but also to the majority of voting rights and management controls. In addition, the Thai authorities have put in place various harassment and tracking procedures implying obligations for companies with foreign shareholding of 40% and above to disclose the source of funding of Thai shareholders. Similar procedures are aimed at addressing specific problem of the acquisition of land by foreigners. Furthermore, EU investors are put at a disadvantage vis-&agrave;-vis U.S. investors who still benefit from national treatment provisions in the US-Thailand Treaty of Amity 1968 with regard to establishing and acquiring interests in enterprises of all types for engaging in commercial, industrial, financial and other business activities, with the exception of a few sectors (inland transportation and communication industries, banking involving depository functions, fiduciary functions, business of inland communication, domestic trade in indigenous agricultural products and exploiting land or other natural resources), although the WTO derogation from Art. II GATS (MFN-clause) expired at the end of 2004 (after 10 years).\n&nbsp;\nApart from the FBA, a number of service sectors are also regulated by sectoral laws under respective regulators e.g. insurance, banking, telecommunications, transport, etc. Regulators in certain sectors like insurance and banking, while maintaining a general rule on Thai majority ownership, still allow foreign majority ownership on a case-by-case basis. However, some regulators could be very protective e.g. in telecommunications where the regulator has introduced foreign dominance criteria (e.g. management control, using preferential stock with different voting rights to control, etc.) in addition to the equity ownership, which is the only general criterion in Thailand's GATS commitments. The regulator in civil aviation also plans to introduce foreign dominance criteria in air transport services similarly to the one in the telecommunications by October 2016. Thailand is free to regulate in the air transport services as there is no international commitment made on Mode 3 of the sector (except for some activities like maintenance or selling and marketing of air transport services). While these foreign dominance criteria have not had material impact on European business in the market, it will certainly have an impact on new entry.",

            "title": "Customs issues",
            "description": "1) Customs valuation: Since 1 September 2006, Thailand systematically used a theoretical value to determine the customs value instead of the declared transaction value, (C.I.F), thus substantially increasing the amount of customs duties and indirect taxes imposed on imported products. . After formal WTO consultations in 2008 on the valuation of spirits, Thailand quickly adhered to correct valuation practices. However, other problems have been encountered with in other products sold between non-related parties, such as cars where systematic wrong-doing, in terms of undervalued invoicing, is consistently reported and has lead to increase in parallel imports, concerns on unfair competition and creation of 'grey markets'. In this respect, we are also concerned about a number of proposed amendments to the liquor law. In particular, we fear that increasing the Excise Department's powers to assess the taxable base by granting powers to the DG of Excise Department to reassesses CIF price for excise purposes can reintroduce from the back door the illegal systematic use of construed value that was abandoned by Customs. Similar concerns relate to valuation of cars manufactured in the free zones by the Excise Department.\n2) Customs reward and penalty schemes: Thai customs has an incentive program rewarding officials for identifying importers suspected of false declaration of origin, false product classification, or false customs valuation. As the reward is based on a percentage of the recovered revenues/penalties (between 10 and 55%), the maximisation of the latter is encouraged. In practice, therefore, Customs officials have a strong incentive to use all means available (i.e., criminal law and threats with significant retroactive Customs penalties) to investigate importers who are alleged to have committed the aforementioned offences. Concerning the penalties charged on smuggled goods, in the past importers and exporters found to have smuggled goods would be fined four times of the value of the goods including tax, which was considered very high, particularly in cases where operators had no intention to violate the law. The Customs Department has proposed amending the Customs Act B.E. 2469 (1926), last amended in 2005 to set a cap for the reward as well as to reduce these penalties based upon certain factors such as the degree of seriousness of the offense. However, we feel that the proposed cap on reward scheme is far too high and continues to provide an incentive for misuse of the mechanisms and even corruption among enforcement authorities.\n3) Dual standard practices of Rules of Origin/ local content: EU companies manufacturing and assembling cars in Thailand in the Customs Free Zone are affected by different practices by different Thai authorities when applying preferential rules of origin. When the car is intended for exports outside of Thai territory (i.e. in other ASEAN countries or even exported to 3rd countries including EU), it would be deemed to have fulfilled the Thai/ASEAN origin requirement (40% local content, whatever the actual origin of this local content) and certified as such, whereas when the identical car produced under the same conditions is imported into the Thai territory, the Thai Customs will refuse to recognise the Thai/ASEAN origin of the products by imposing more stringent conditions for the local content. Similar difficulties in inconsistent application of cost calculation methods in determining origin have been raised by other manufacturers, such producers of optical lenses.\n4) The de minimis threshold: The Thai Customs apply a de minimis regime that exempts goods with the value of 1,000 THB (around Euro 25) or less from formal entry procedures. This amount is considered to be too low to facilitate trade and reduce costs in particular for SMEs and free up resources for Customs. The EU therefore encourages the Thai Government to raise its de minimis threshold to a level comparable with regional standards (i.e. 3,000 THB or 75 Euro) in order to enhance supply-chain connectivity.",

It is perceived that the Thai practice is aimed at protecting their national industry which is also characterised by a monopolistic structure, thus leaving the national producer a lot of margin to set the price at the domestic market and use these profits to undercut prices on foreign and EU markets and thus to increase respective exports considerably.\nThailand applies a discretionary import licensing procedure on worked monumental and building stones including cut and polished marble and granite. Importers need to obtain prior authorisation from the Ministry of Commerce and importation is only authorised for the quantity needed for specified construction projects. Cut and polished stones cannot be imported for other purposes (e.g. kitchen counters, furniture). This licensing system operates as a de facto import prohibition to the Thai market.",

EU industry is, however, concerned with the overall cumbersome structure in the sector, and lack of transparency of Thailand&rsquo;s telecom regulatory practices, which contribute to an increasingly unpredictable business environment which is not conducive to foreign investment. Moreover, Thailand does not facilitate reform of the State Owned Enterprises/ concessions evolution which are essential to generate growth, protect consumers and create a level playing field for competition in the telecoms sector. The combined effect of these practices have not only hampered market access to foreign and foreign-invested companies in Thailand but also have restricted service availability and standards, and delayed access to advanced technology and reduced prices to the detriment of Thai consumers of telecommunication services. The notification (regulation of 18 July 2012 by the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) revises foreign dominance criteria in the telecom sector by taking into account such elements as voting rights, board appointments and also management control and supply relationship as well as shareholding. Industry has raised questions as to its compatibility with the GATS and the investment climate in the sector may worsen further as a result.&nbsp;",

As a result, trade in pork and pork meat from EU countries was stopped even though health certificates were in place. No information was given to the exporting country justifying an import ban. Since 1 October 2013 Malaysia set up a new import permit under the responsability of MAQIS, the Malaysia Quarantine Inspection Service, operating under the Ministry of Agriculture. MAQIS focus primarily on documentary checks, but can also perform inspections and sampling.\nMalaysia confirmed the adoption of the pre-listing system for pork at the beginning of 2014. In theory, once a Member State is approved for exporting pork and pork products, the Competent Authority of this Member State can propose to Malaysia the addition of new establishments to the approved list. Malaysia should accept the additions without the need to perform an audit on the referred establishments. However, in practice,&nbsp;Malaysia insists on auditing each&nbsp;establishment interested in exporting to Malaysia, even those&nbsp;which Member States have approved to export to them.\n\n\nCost of audits in EU exporting countries continue to be borne by the exporting side.\n",

Per applicant country and per commodity, authorities need to submit an application to China for being granted market access for meat/meat products. The procedure maintained by China is not clear and can take several years before it is finalised and market access is granted. This measure has hampered trade flow between EU exporters and China and it is considered a barrier to trade. A wide range of different meat products are under the scope of this procedure, such as: pork meat, pork meat products, bovine meat, bovine meat products, ovine meat, ovine meat products and poultry meat (fresh, chilled or frozen).\nCurrently, Chinese regulations require a prior on-site inspection to be carried out by China in all those establishments which want to export into China, to verify the import requirements for the product concerned. If additional establishments of an authorised country for a certain commodity wants to export to China, then a new application request needs to take place with China requiring an on-site inspection in that establishments. However, international standards of Codex laid down that such audits should be focused on the performance of the authority of the exporting country, as a prior step to allow exports if all requirements are fulfilled by the exporting country. This means that the international standards give clear preference to the evaluation of official inspection and certification rather than specific commodities or establishments. The Chinese procedure causes undue delays and hindrances to market access. In addition to that, the current application process is not predictable, not transparent and lengthy. Once again, China does not comply with WTO SPS commitments (Annex C: control, inspection and approval procedures). The WTO SPS agreement requires that such procedures are undertaken and completed without undue delay and in no less favourable manner for imported products than for like domestic products. In addition, the standard processing period of each procedure is published or the anticipated processing period is communicated to the application upon request.\nFor years, the EU has frequently raised its concerns in bilateral meetings, underlining the fact that China should follow international standards and thus to respect its international obligations.

Current Chinese import requirements include heavy testing requirements which makes trade unnecessarily costly for exporters. Most important differences noted in the Chinese standards in comparison with international standards are related to: levels of yeast and mould, cheese definitions, methods used and list of raw material and permitted ingredients. Member States with exporting interest into China of dairy products are affected.\nThis non-alignment of Chinese standards with international standards goes against the WTO SPS Agreement, concretely against article 3 (harmonisation) which states that members shall base their sanitary and phytosanitary measures on international standards, guidelines or recommendations. So far China has not provided its risk assessment based on science justifying its deviation from these international standards.\nThis issue has been raised by EU in different bilateral meetings with China with a view to find an amical solution on this matter. China has informed to plan to review its cheese standards, which is welcomed by the EU.\n&nbsp;",

However, the Chinese import conditions for these commodities are stricter than those described by the international standards of the international standard organisation for animal health (OIE). \nIn addition, for some other Member States the country-wide ban has been lifted (NL in 2014; IRL in 2015) but the Chinese process for granting access to their market is still not finalised despite all detailed requested information being provided which would allow for China to finalise their assessment. China has never provided its risk analysis justifying for keeping its bans on the EU in place.\nChina unjustifiably discriminates between trading partners, it allows imports from other countries, than EU countries, which have the same BSE country risk status as set by the international standard organisation for animal health (OIE), indeed the majority of the EU Member States are categorised by the OIE with a negligible BSE risk status. According to the WTO SPS Agreement, Members should base their SPS measures on international standards and should not unjustifiably discriminate between Members. Also, the import procedures are burdensome and unnecessarily lengthy for the EU. This procedure is against WTO SPS Agreement, related to Annex C: control, inspection and approval procedures. It states that these procedures should be undertaken and completed without undue delay and in no less favourable manner for imported products than for like domestic products. Several EU Member State application requests for exports of beef to China were launched already in year 2005.\nThe EU continues to raise this issue with China with a view to find an amical solution to this now too longstanding ban on EU beef/ovine and other bovine/ovine products. The issue has been raised at different levels, both at technical and political level and in the plenary of the WTO SPS Committee.",

            "description": "Since February 2014, the Competent Authority of China (AQSIQ and MoA) did impose a country-wide ban on EU Member State where African swine fever (ASF) was detected. The international standards for animal health (OIE) clearly define conditions to allow safe trade to continue from non-affected areas (regionalisation measures) and on which products can be safely continued to be traded when an outbreak of African swine fever occurs. Upon detection of the virus on its territory, the EU has immediately implemented stringent control measures in the affected areas and implemented regionalisation measures guaranteeing that trade of pigs and pig products can continue to take place under safe conditions. These measures have proven to be effective and are fully in line with international standards and trading partners have been provided with detailed information on the stringent EU measures put in place guaranteeing that safe trade can continue to take place. Therefore, the EU considers a country-wide ban imposed by China due to ASF overly trade restrictive and not in line with international standards, neither with the requirements under the WTO SPS Agreement. Poland is mainly affect by this trade barrier.\nThis country-wide ban is considered disproportionate and not in line with China's international obligations, instead China should recognise EU's stringent regionalisation measures and thus limit its trade restrictions to the well-identified affected areas in the EU. China is thus not recognising disease free areas as foreseen under the WTO SPS Agreement and not following international standards set by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).\nChina's legislation imposes a country-wide ban for certain animal diseases, such as African swine fever and the procedure for lifting such a country-wide ban lacks transparency and predictability. China does not allow recognition of regionalisation measures as implemented in the EU. China has not provided its risk analysis based on science for maintaining the country-wide ban. This procedure is against WTO SPS Agreement, in particular related to Annex C: control, inspection and approval procedures. It states that these procedures are undertaken and completed without undue delay and in no less favourable manner for imported products than for like domestic products.\nThe Commission has raised this matter with China in different fora.

A wide range of products are affected by these restrictions, in general live birds and their products.\nChina legislation requires to impose a country-wide ban on the whole exporting country whenever there is a notification of Highly Pathogenic avian influenza, instead of limiting the ban to the affected areas where stringent measures are in place to prevent further spreading and to continue safe trade. Exports of poultry and poultry products are immediately blocked. China is thus not recognising disease free areas (regionalisation) as foreseen under the WTO SPS Agreement (article 6) and does not following international standards set by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). In addition, China does require a lengthy, non-transparent and burdensome procedure for the lifting of the country-wide ban. The international standard of the OIE clearly states that a free status of the country, zone, compartment, can be regained three months after a stamping-out policy has applied. The EU policy applies a strict stamping-out policy in accordance with international rules of the OIE and informs the OIE and trading partners accordingly. Despite all detailed information made available to China by the EU guaranteeing safe trade can continue to take place, China does not recognise the regionalisation measures put in place in the EU and neither respects the three months period defined by the OIE for lifting the trade restrictions.\nThis important issue has frequently been raised in bilateral and multilateral context with China, but to date China has not replied to the request of EU to recognise the principle of regionalisation as applied in EU.

Therefore, Israel prohibits imports of non-kosher meat (with a limited exception of for some non-kosher meat products of around 1,200 tons annually), while it allows the domestic production and marketing of non-kosher meat. As regards imports of other kosher products, such as cheese and dairy products, the Rabbinical supervision in the exporting countries is not sufficient and an additionalcertification by the Israeli Chief Rabbinate is required.\nIn late 2015&nbsp;fresh meat was exported from Poland for the first time. The EU asked the Chief Rabbinate to allow for recognition of kosher slaughtering done by Rabbis in Europe to reduce or eliminate&nbsp; the cost of the Chief Rabbinate's supervision on the ground in the EU MS concerned.&nbsp;Due to the high political sensitivity of the issue for the time being the Israeli&nbsp;Government is reluctant to push for rapid changes. Instead the Government opted for an incremental approach to increase imports of fresh meat from the EU through among others initiating meetings with the EU side to explain the requirements to import to the country and also through streamlining the veterinary certification. The aim is&nbsp;that this process will gradually create the conditions to ease the quasi monopoly position of the Chief Rabbinate in recognizing kosher slaughtering. This would also serve the&nbsp;Israeli&nbsp;Government's ultimate objective to reduce the cost of living in the country.",

            "description": "The Representation law 194/93 regulates relations between foreign companies that export to Paraguay and local representatives / distributors in Paraguay. Under this law compensation has to be paid to the representative, when foreign exporters, without a justifiable reason, cancel, revoke, modify or do not renew their contract with a local representative / distributor in Paraguay. The amount of compensation is set through the judiciary or through arbitration. The law provides only broad criteria, leaving much to the discretion of the courts, which creates a situation of legal uncertainty for European exporters. There is a current legal draft in discussion to reinforce even more the protection of local representatives / distributors.\n&nbsp;\nBackground\nThe Representation law (Law No. 194 of 6 July 1993, which replaced the Decreto-Ley 7 of 27 March 1991), establishes the legal framework governing relationships between foreign companies that export to Paraguay and their Paraguayan representatives. The law requires that exporters to Paraguay prove just cause when they terminate, modify or fail to renew contracts with Paraguayan distributors or agents. If such a relationship is ended without proving just cause, the foreign company must pay its representative an indemnity, which is not fixed in the law. This is giving rise to broad discretional criteria of the court to fix this amount, which creates a situation of legal uncertainty for foreign firms. It seems that in some cases foreign companies paid large sums when ending distribution relationships in Paraguay to avoid lengthy court cases or have maintained ineffective representatives to avoid such payments.\nUnder Law 194/93, the amount of compensation is set through the judiciary or arbitration based on (1) the length of the agreement and (2) the gross earnings of the representative / distributor. All foreign exporters / importers can cancel, revoke, modify or not renew their contract with the local representative/distributor without paying compensation provided there is a justified reason for it, notably one of the following:a. breach of the contract;b. fraud or abuse of trust in the duties entrusted;c. ineptitude or negligence;d. any act imputable to the representative/distributor, which results in damage to the sales, distribution etc.;e. conflict of interest.\nBefore claiming any of the above the exporter shall ask the representative / distributor to solve the problem within 120 days. Following this period, the exporter can claim its rights immediately except in cases of fraud or abuse of trust. The importer should make its claim before the judiciary or through arbitration, otherwise unjustified reasons will be assumed. In the event of cancellation, irrespective of the compensation awarded, the representative / distributor has the right to sell the existing stock to the exporter at market price (i.e. including profit).\nThe agreement between importer and representative/distributor can be demonstrated by one or more of the following:- Authorising letter to manage the local market.- Bills that demonstrate trading deals between the parties.- Payment for a commission to the representative / distributor for trading deals during at least the last two years before the entry into force of this law.- Advertising and publicity expenses claiming the representative/distributor role, the importer being aware of it and not opposing it.- Claims by representative / distributor of commissions for operations not done through him, which have been paid by the importer.\nThis legal uncertainty has the effect of deterring EU companies from exporting to Paraguay. These restrictions could deny the Paraguayan economy inputs that are necessary for its development. In addition, by offering disproportionate protection to local operators, beyond their legitimate needs, the law protects and rewards inefficiency, which does not serve the interests of the Paraguayan economy.The termination indemnities and other requirements apply only to foreign suppliers. Local suppliers are not obliged under this law or under similar conditions regarding the relationships with distributors or agents.",

            "description": "Access to public procurement for foreign bidders is restricted to specific cases and conditions. International public competitive bidding in Paraguay is used as an exception to national bidding only in specific circumstances and, in the event of equivalent offers, preference is given to the offers which incorporate certain levels of local content. In addition when assessing the economic value of different bids, contracting entities may grant a certain margin of preference of up to 10%. In 2010 Paraguay introduced with decree 4008/2010 price preferences for goods and services of Paraguayan origin for a period of one year. Decree 6225/2011 and law 4558/2011 replaced decree 4008/2010 and continue with similar margins of preference for local content. These preferences from 5% up to 70% and have the aim of increasing national production and local employment.\n&nbsp;\nBackground\nAccording to Paraguayan legislation (Ley 2051/2003 de Contrataciones P&uacute;blicas), access to public procurement for foreign bidders (not domiciled in Paraguay) is restricted to the following cases: obligation under an international treaty, agreements with international organisations (such as a loan agreement with a multilateral institution), insufficient local supply of goods and services of the quality required or price of such goods or services is not suitable, and in the case that no proposal was submitted in a national tendering procedure (Article 18 of Ley 2051 of 2003 ). Moreover, companies from countries with no reciprocal treatment for Paraguayan firms can be excluded from bidding.\nInternational public competitive bidding in Paraguay is used as an exception to national bidding only in specific circumstances and, in the event of equivalent offers, preference is given to the offers which incorporate more that 50% of local content. In addition when assessing the economic value of different bids, contracting entities may grant a margin of preference of up to 10% (Article 18 of Ley 2051/2003).\nOn 26 February 2010 Paraguay introduced with decree 4008/2010 national price preferences in public tenders for a period of one year, which was replaced by decree 6225/2011 and law 4558/2011 (see below). Paraguay has introduced these temporary preferences in order to increase national production and local employment to overcome the international economic crisis. The margin of preferences shall be determined by the contracting entities and range between 5% and 70% for manufactured goods and between 20% to 70% for primary products of agricultural origin. For construction services, the contracting entity can require the contractors to have at least 70% of the personnel locally recruited.\nOn 4 March 2011 Paraguay published decree 6225/2011 which replaced decree 4008/2010 regarding public works and infrastructure. The margin of preferences may range between 5% and 70%, for manufactured products 40%, for primary products of agricultural origin between 20% and 70%, for construction services at least 70% of the personnel must be locally recruited, and for services 10%.\nOn 15 December 2011 Paraguay published Law (Ley) 4558/2011 regarding good and services, which foresees in national tenders a margin of preferences of 20% for local products and services. National products are defined as being from Paraguayan origin or with an imported part of up to 40%, while national construction services require at least 70% of the locally recruited personnel. Decree 9649/2012 of 7 September 2012 provides details on regarding the determination of national origin concerning the Law 4558/2011.",

The reform provides for liability of internet service providers (ISP), increases sanctions, and regulates the extent and scope of private copies. However, it is necessary to strengthen measures against digital piracy and ensure effective action to address illegal content on the internet. A system of notifications by ISPs to subscribers suspected of infringing copyright material came into effect in 2012 and is being used by the six major ISPs representing 95% of the fixed broadband market. The government ran a major public awareness campaign about this system. It is hoped that this system will be effective and avoid a certain number of court cases as having to resort to court orders to take-down illegal material from the internet is time consuming and costly. More enforcement on the streets is necessary. The proper implementation of the law and the notification system has to be monitored carefully.\n&nbsp;\nBackground\nThe modified Copyright Law introduces civil and criminal remedies; rules on liability of online intermediaries; mediation and arbitration procedures; rules on collective management societies; increase in all applicable fines; no discrimination between the physical and the digital environment; higher sanctions for piracy on a commercial scale; a list of exceptions and limitations to copyright.\nInternet piracy occurs most significantly via peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing of infringing content, but also through hosted sites and, increasingly, illegal mobile downloads. Chile&rsquo;s amended Copyright Law creates a \"notice plus notice\" architecture but lacks the threat of any real consequences for typical online piracy and fails to impute liability upon an ISP that gains knowledge of infringement outside of a court order. The Chilean law provides for no sanctions in case the online intermediary does not give notice to the infringer within the deadline of 5 days.\nThe aforementioned factors cause concerns about the effectiveness of the rules providing for the liability of online intermediaries. However, a system of notification to subscribers suspected of infringing copyright came into effect in 2012 and is used by the six major ISPs. The private sector is concerned with the need for the involvement of the judicial system (court order) which is a lengthy and costly process and hopes that the notification system will prove effective in reducing online piracy.\nOn enforcement, Chile does not envisage the creation of a specialised enforcement agency on ISP liability or any adoption of implementing regulations thereon. Although there is some good cooperation with Chilean criminal and civil enforcement authorities, additional resources are needed to raise street actions and increased prioritization on the part of the judiciary. Police and customs officials take ex officio actions on a regular basis and involve rights holders in legal procedures. However, more enforcement actions would be needed against Internet sites. Prosecutions for copyright crimes are too infrequent and rarely result in deterrent sentencing and civil actions face procedural obstacles and delays.",

Moreover, foreign ownership requirements in the broadcasting sector limit the provision of pay TV services, which undermines the development of broadband in the country.\nAdditionally, Brazil does not facilitate the provision of satellite services offered by EU satellite providers although such services correspond to today&rsquo;s business model notably in business-to-business activities.\n&nbsp;\nBackground\nDespite the reform of Brazil&rsquo;s telecom framework back in 1998 and the permission of foreign access when the current legislation was enforced, several obstacles still remain hampering EU business in an important way and others are being raised, mainly the growing state intervention in the telecommunications sector, the foreign ownership requirements in the broadcasting sector which limit the provision of pay TV services and the cross border provision of satellite services.",

            "description": "The US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which was enacted in March 2010, and is due to become operative from 1 July this year, is designed to increase the ability of the US tax authorities to combat cross-border tax evasion by US persons who use foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to hide assets and avoid reporting income taxable in the US. FATCA tries to achieve this objective by imposing obligations on the FFIs to carry out due-diligence, reporting and withholding tasks on behalf of the US tax authorities. FFIs are defined to include not just banks but also funds, insurance companies, securitisation vehicles and many other entities.&nbsp;While FATCA&rsquo;s aim is a legitimate one which the EU and many other countries support, it has caused serious concern to financial intermediaries because of the legal problems and administrative burdens that it will create.In recognition of the many legal difficulties that foreign financial institutions may face in reporting directly to the US under FATCA, the US is currently concluding FATCA agreements with other countries under which the financial institutions will report to the tax authorities of their own countries instead of directly to the US and will not be required to withhold US tax (except in few specific cases).The tax authorities of those countries will then report the information to the US tax authorities.While these FATCA agreements may eliminate all or most of the legal difficulties for financial institutions, potentially they will not remove all the difficulties for EU financial institutions to invest in the US market or market their products to US clients since i.a. to do so will now carry reporting obligations.Furthermore, FATCA does not impose on US financial institutions the same obligations that it imposes on FFIs. They do not have the same level of due diligence, reporting and withholding obligations in relation to US citizens and they are not required to report on anything other than interest payments and US source dividends paid to non-US citizens.",

            "description": "he Lacey Act, initially adopted in 1900, is the United States' oldest national wildlife protection statute and serves as an anti-trafficking law protecting a broad range of wildlife and wild plants. In May 2008, the Lacey Act was amended to extend its scope to all plants, including timber or associated wood products with the objective to combat illegal logging. The amendment added a new requirement for an import declaration, which will oblige importers of covered plants and plant products to list shipment information along with information such as plant scientific name and country of harvest to prove compliance with the Lacey Act requirements. Domestic products are not subject to similar reporting requirements.\nImport declaration requirements have been all phased in according to a schedule established in the 2008 amendments. In the initial phase (which started on 15th December 2008), the declaration was voluntary. Obligatory declarations were gradually phased in starting from 1 April 2009 as regards certain wood products (HTS Chapter 44), and as regards some additional products from 1 April 2010 onwards (umbrellas, hand tools, pianos, stringed instruments, revolvers and pistols, seats with wood frames, sculptures). U.S. APHIS is in the process of moving to an online system for processing declarations, which had previously been all paper-based.",

Combined procedure is burdensome and costly, especially where several different products are required.\nUnder the SON-CAP regime, imported goods need to undergo pre-shipment certification through authorized service providers. Goods are only released at arrival upon production of completed SON-CAP certificates. The cost of this procedure amounts to some $600 per container/per product; meaning that for mixed shipments (containing different products) this fee will multiply accordingly. Validity of certificates varies between 6 months and 1 year.\nUnder the obligatory e-registration scheme, introduced in 2013, all products (i.e. both imported and locally manufactured) in the above sectors have to be registered electronically on Standards Organisation of Nigeria&rsquo;s online platform. The goal is to provide an online database to support SON in tracking and tackling substandard goods in the Nigerian market. http://www.son.gov.ng/.\nDiscussions with concerned parties/stakeholders indicate that per product and model (even change of colour, size or type), registration costs about (additional) $ 600 per item. The maximum validity period for e-registration is 1 year only. This duration is short and represents additional costs for the importer, who is required to renew registration after a year, at most, even when there is no change in the product.In addition to the huge fees, importers face difficulties in using SONs online platform, where key documents and information on the new e-registration system are absent",
