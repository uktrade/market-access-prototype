"""
Use HTTP Authorization to log in to django site.

Source: https://djangosnippets.org/snippets/1720/

If you use the FORCE_HTTP_AUTH=True in your settings.py, then ONLY
Http Auth will be used, if you don't then either http auth or 
django's session-based auth will be used.

If you provide a HTTP_AUTH_REALM in your settings, that will be used as
the realm for the challenge.
